  abstract  = {Hydrogels are materials widely used in countless applications{,} particularly in the biomedical{,} pharmaceutical{,} and nutraceutical fields{,} because of their biocompatibility and their mechanical and transport properties. Several approaches are known to evaluate their properties{,} but only a few approaches are under development to mathematically describe their behaviour{,} in terms of how the materials answer to mechanical stimuli and how incorporated active substances are released. In this review{,} the main properties of hydrogels are summarized and the structure–property relationships are investigated (i.e. how the macromolecular structure influences the properties of macroscopic samples made of hydrogels). A selection criterion is proposed based on the comparison of three characteristic times: relaxation time{,} diffusion time{,} and process time. Then{,} the most common experimental methods to investigate the hydrogel properties are summarized{,} along with the state-of-the-art of mathematical modelling{,} with reference to the mechanical and transport properties of hydrogels{,} with particular attention to the viscoelastic and poroelastic behaviours. Last but not least{,} some case histories which can be classified as viscoelastic{,} poroelastic{,} or poroviscoelastic behaviours are presented.},

  abstract = {An elastomeric gel is a mixture of a polymer network and a solvent. In response to changes in mechanical forces and in the chemical potential of the solvent in the environment, the gel evolves by two concurrent molecular processes: the conformational change of the network, and the migration of the solvent. The two processes result in viscoelasticity and poroelasticity, and are characterized by two material-specific properties: the time of viscoelastic relaxation and the effective diffusivity of the solvent through the network. The two properties define a material-specific length. The material-specific time and length enable us to discuss macroscopic observations made over different lengths and times, and identify limiting conditions in which viscoelastic and poroelastic relaxations have either completed or yet started. We formulate a model of homogeneous deformation, and use several examples to illustrate viscoelasticity-limited solvent migration, where the migration of the solvent is pronounced, but the size of the gel is so small that the rate of change is limited by viscoelasticity. We further describe a theory that evolves a gel through inhomogeneous states. Both infinitesimal and finite deformation are considered.},

  abstract = {Mechanics plays a crucial role in the growth, development, and therapeutics of tumors. In this paper, a nonlinear poroelastic theory is established to describe the mechanical behaviors of solid tumors. The free-swollen state of a tumor is chosen as the reference state, which enables us to avoid pursuing a dry and stress-free state that is hard to achieve for living tissues. Our results reveal that the compression resistance of a tumor is primarily attributed to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) swelling, and the compactness of cell aggregates is found to affect tumor consolidation. Over-expressed GAGs and dense cell aggregates can stiffen the tumor, a remodeling mechanism that makes the tumor with higher elastic modulus than its surrounding host tissues. Glycosaminoglycan chains also influence the transient mechanical response of the tumor by modulating the tissue permeability. The theoretical results show good agreement with relevant experimental observations. This study may not only deepen our understanding of tumorigenesis but also provide cues for developing novel anticancer strategies.},
