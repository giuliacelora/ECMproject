  abstract  = {Hydrogels are materials widely used in countless applications{,} particularly in the biomedical{,} pharmaceutical{,} and nutraceutical fields{,} because of their biocompatibility and their mechanical and transport properties. Several approaches are known to evaluate their properties{,} but only a few approaches are under development to mathematically describe their behaviour{,} in terms of how the materials answer to mechanical stimuli and how incorporated active substances are released. In this review{,} the main properties of hydrogels are summarized and the structureâ€“property relationships are investigated (i.e. how the macromolecular structure influences the properties of macroscopic samples made of hydrogels). A selection criterion is proposed based on the comparison of three characteristic times: relaxation time{,} diffusion time{,} and process time. Then{,} the most common experimental methods to investigate the hydrogel properties are summarized{,} along with the state-of-the-art of mathematical modelling{,} with reference to the mechanical and transport properties of hydrogels{,} with particular attention to the viscoelastic and poroelastic behaviours. Last but not least{,} some case histories which can be classified as viscoelastic{,} poroelastic{,} or poroviscoelastic behaviours are presented.},

  abstract  = {Immersed in a solution of small molecules and ions, a network of long-chain polymers may imbibe the solution and swell, resulting in a polymeric gel. Depending on the molecular structure of the polymers, the amount of swelling can be regulated by moisture, mechanical forces, ionic strength, electric field, pH value, and many other types of stimuli. Starting from the basic principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, this chapter formulates a field theory of the coupled large deformation and mass transportation in a neutral polymeric gel. The theory is then extended to study polyelectrolyte gels with charge-carrying networks by accounting for the electromechanical coupling and migration of solute ions. While the theoretical framework is adaptable to various types of material models, some representative ones are described through specific free-energy functions and kinetic laws. A specific material law for pH-sensitive gels---a special type of polyelectrolyte gels---is introduced as an example of incorporating chemical reactions in modeling stimuli-responsive gels. Finally, a simplified theory for the equilibrium but inhomogeneous swelling of a polymeric gel is deduced. The theory and the specific material models are illustrated through several examples.},

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) of a solid tumor not only affords scaffolding to support tumor architecture and integrity but also plays an essential role in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutics. In this paper, a non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory is established to study the chemo-mechanical behaviors of tumor ECM, which is modeled as a poroelastic polyelectrolyte consisting of a collagen network and proteoglycans. By using the principle of maximum energy dissipation rate, we deduce a set of governing equations for drug transport and mechanosensitive enzymatic degradation in ECM. The results reveal that osmosis is primarily responsible for the compression resistance of ECM. It is suggested that a well-designed ECM degradation can effectively modify the tumor microenvironment for improved efficiency of cancer therapy. The theoretical predictions show a good agreement with relevant experimental observations. This study aimed to deepen our understanding of tumor ECM may be conducive to novel anticancer strategies.},
