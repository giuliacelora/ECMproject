  abstract  = {Hydrogels are materials widely used in countless applications{,} particularly in the biomedical{,} pharmaceutical{,} and nutraceutical fields{,} because of their biocompatibility and their mechanical and transport properties. Several approaches are known to evaluate their properties{,} but only a few approaches are under development to mathematically describe their behaviour{,} in terms of how the materials answer to mechanical stimuli and how incorporated active substances are released. In this review{,} the main properties of hydrogels are summarized and the structure–property relationships are investigated (i.e. how the macromolecular structure influences the properties of macroscopic samples made of hydrogels). A selection criterion is proposed based on the comparison of three characteristic times: relaxation time{,} diffusion time{,} and process time. Then{,} the most common experimental methods to investigate the hydrogel properties are summarized{,} along with the state-of-the-art of mathematical modelling{,} with reference to the mechanical and transport properties of hydrogels{,} with particular attention to the viscoelastic and poroelastic behaviours. Last but not least{,} some case histories which can be classified as viscoelastic{,} poroelastic{,} or poroviscoelastic behaviours are presented.},

  abstract = {An elastomeric gel is a mixture of a polymer network and a solvent. In response to changes in mechanical forces and in the chemical potential of the solvent in the environment, the gel evolves by two concurrent molecular processes: the conformational change of the network, and the migration of the solvent. The two processes result in viscoelasticity and poroelasticity, and are characterized by two material-specific properties: the time of viscoelastic relaxation and the effective diffusivity of the solvent through the network. The two properties define a material-specific length. The material-specific time and length enable us to discuss macroscopic observations made over different lengths and times, and identify limiting conditions in which viscoelastic and poroelastic relaxations have either completed or yet started. We formulate a model of homogeneous deformation, and use several examples to illustrate viscoelasticity-limited solvent migration, where the migration of the solvent is pronounced, but the size of the gel is so small that the rate of change is limited by viscoelasticity. We further describe a theory that evolves a gel through inhomogeneous states. Both infinitesimal and finite deformation are considered.},

In this paper, a nonlinear poroelastic theory is established to describe the mechanical behaviors of solid tumors. The free-swollen state of a tumor is chosen as the reference state, which enables us to avoid pursuing a dry and stress-free state that is hard to achieve for living tissues. Our results reveal that the compression resistance of a tumor is primarily attributed to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) swelling, and the compactness of cell aggregates is found to affect tumor consolidation. Over-expressed GAGs and dense cell aggregates can stiffen the tumor, a remodeling mechanism that makes the tumor with higher elastic modulus than its surrounding host tissues. Glycosaminoglycan chains also influence the transient mechanical response of the tumor by modulating the tissue permeability. The theoretical results show good agreement with relevant experimental observations. This study may not only deepen our understanding of tumorigenesis but also provide cues for developing novel anticancer strategies.},

The scope of this chapter is to propose a model, simple enough and with a limited number of parameters to be determined, able to capture the full behavior of a swelling hydrogel, with the aim of describing the drug release process as well as—in principle—any other application of hydrogels. The model was derived recalling the basics of the continuum mechanics, the possible approaches to estimate the Helmholtz free energy, and then writing the transport and constitutive equations for a poroelastic material, and for a more realistic poroviscoelastic material (by adding the standard linear solid model as the rheological model). A full extension to multicomponent systems, to describe the drug release phenomenon, is proposed along with a sensitivity analysis (free-swelling simulation by changing the model parameters).},

In this paper, a thermodynamics-based nonlinear poroelastic theory is established to model the coupling among the mechanical, chemical, and biological mechanisms governing avascular tumor growth. A volumetric growth law accounting for mechano-chemo-biological coupled effects is proposed to describe the development of solid tumors. The regulating roles of stresses and nutrient transport in the tumor growth are revealed under different environmental constraints. We show that the mechano-chemo-biological coupling triggers anisotropic and heterogeneous growth, leading to the formation of layered structures in a growing tumor. There exists a steady state in which tumor growth is balanced by resorption. The influence of external confinements on tumor growth is also examined. A phase diagram is constructed to illustrate how the elastic modulus and thickness of the confinements jointly dictate the steady state of tumor volume. Qualitative and quantitative agreements with experimental observations indicate the developed model is capable of capturing the essential features of avascular tumor growth in various environments.},

Bulk and surface conditions are obtained and for each of them practical expressions are given in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. The concept of open-system elastic constants leads to the reformulation of internal elastochemical equilibrium problems into purely elastic problems, whose solutions are then used to compute the composition distribution. The atmosphere around a dislocation in a cubic crystal is one of several examples that are completely worked out. The effects of vacancies, and their equilibrium within a solid and near surfaces are critically examined and previous formulas are found to be first order approximations. Consequences of the boundary equations that govern phase changes are studied with several examples. Finally, problems connected with diffusional kinetics and diffusional creep are discussed.
Résumé
Nous étudions, la thermodynamique de cristaux sous contrainte qui peuvent changer de phase et de composition, en prêtant particulièrement attention aux hypothèses utilisées et aux approximations faites. Nous obtenons des conditions dans le matériau massif et en surface et pour chacune d'entr'elles nous donnons des expressions pratiques en fonction de quantités mesurables expérimentalement. Le concept de constantes élastiques d'un système ouvert conduit à reformuler les problèmes d'équilibre élastochimique interne en problèmes purement éleastiques; on utilise alors leurs solutions pour calculer la répartition des compositions. L'atmosphère autour d'une dislocation dans un cristal cubique est l'un des exemples qui sont entièrement résolus. Nous examinons d'une manière les effets des lacunes et leur équilibre critique á l'intérieur d'un solide et au voisinage de la surface et nous montrons que des formules antérieures sont des approximations du premier ordre. Nous étudions les conséquences des équations aux limites qui gouvernent les changements de phases, avec plusieurs exemples. Enfin, nous discutons des problèmes liés à la cinétique de diffusion et au fluage de diffusion.
Zusammenfassung
Das thermodynamische Verhalten von verspannten Kristallen, bei denen sich Phase und Zusammensetzung ändern können, wurde insbesondere im Hinblick auf die benützten Hypothesen und Annahmen untersucht Volumen- und Oberflächenbedingungen werden ermittelt. Für jede Bedingung werden praktische Ausdrücke mit experimentell meβbaren Gröβen angegeben. Das Konzept der elastischen Konstanten offener Systeme führt zu einer neuen Formulierung der inneren elastochemischen Gleichgewichtsporbleme mit rein elastischen Problemen, mit deren Lösungen dann die Verteilung der Zusammensetzung berechnet wird. Verschiedene Beispiele werden ausführlich dargestellt, darunter die Wolke um eine Versetzung in einem kubischen Kristall. Der Einfluβ der Leerstellen, ihr Gleichgewicht im Innern eines Festkörpers und in der Nähe der Oberfläche werden kritisch untersucht. Früher erhaltene Formeln stellen sich als Näherungen erster Ordnung heraus. Die Folgerungen aus den Gleichungen für die Grenzen, die die Phasenänderungen beschreiben, werden anhand einiger Beispiele behandelt. Zuletzt werden Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Diffusionskinetik und -kriechen diskutiert.},

By using the principle of maximum energy dissipation rate, we deduce a set of governing equations for drug transport and mechanosensitive enzymatic degradation in ECM. The results reveal that osmosis is primarily responsible for the compression resistance of ECM. It is suggested that a well-designed ECM degradation can effectively modify the tumor microenvironment for improved efficiency of cancer therapy. The theoretical predictions show a good agreement with relevant experimental observations. This study aimed to deepen our understanding of tumor ECM may be conducive to novel anticancer strategies.},

  abstract = {Abstract An equivalent new expression of the triphasic mechano-electrochemical theory [9] is presented and a mixed finite element formulation is developed using the standard Galerkin weighted residual method. Solid displacement us, modified electrochemical/chemical potentials ϵw, ϵ+and ϵ− (with dimensions of concentration) for water, cation and anion are chosen as the four primary degrees of freedom (DOFs) and are independently interpolated. The modified Newton–Raphson iterative procedure is employed to handle the non-linear terms. The resulting first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with respect to time are solved using the implicit Euler backward scheme which is unconditionally stable. One-dimensional (1-D) linear isoparametric element is developed. The final algebraic equations form a non-symmetric but sparse matrix system. With the current choice of primary DOFs, the formulation has the advantage of small amount of storage, and the jump conditions between elements and across the interface boundary are satisfied automatically. The finite element formulation has been used to investigate a 1-D triphasic stress relaxation problem in the confined compression configuration and a 1-D triphasic free swelling problem. The formulation accuracy and convergence for 1-D cases are examined with independent finite difference methods. The FEM results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the other methods.

  abstract = {Phase-field model is a powerful tool for studying the microstructure evolution of materials. This paper seeks to introduce phase-field modeling to the field of soft materials, especially for studying polymeric gels. A general framework for the field theory of coupled large deformation and mass transport is established, and two specific models of diffuse interface are proposed. The ideal liquid-like interface has a deformation-independent energy and gives rise to a constant surface tension, and a non-ideal interface would result in a strain-dependent surface stress. Either model gives a stress field consistent with the effect of interface line force. The field theory is implemented into a finite-element code, and several numerical examples are calculated with representative material models in which deformation is weakly or strongly coupled with mass transport. The numerical models demonstrate the versatility of the phase-field methodology, and reveal some interesting phenomena due to the coupling. For example, the composition of a separated phase is significantly affected by the kinematic constraint, and varies during coarsening.},
