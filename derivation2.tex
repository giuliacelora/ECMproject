\subsection{Energy Balance Inequality.}
\label{sec_ine}

As mentioned in Section \ref{secNET}, in a thermodynamically consistent model, the free energy $\psi$ can not be chosen arbitrarily but needs to satisfy the energy imbalance inequality,~(\ref{energyin}). In this section, we focus on the right-hand side of the inequality which specify how the system exchanges energy and mass with the environment. Considering a control volume $R$ in the reference configuration $\mathcal{B}_0$, the system exchanges mass due to the diffusion of each mobile species, so that $M(R)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
M(R)= \sum\limits_{m=s,1,\ldots,N} - \int_{\partial R} \mu_m \,\mathbf{J}_m \cdot \mathbf{n} 
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to the surface $\partial R$ and $\mu_m$ is the chemical potential associated with each species. Widely used in the thermodynamics of mixture, the chemical potential is a measure of the rate of change in free energy associated with adding one more molecule to a unit volume.

The term $W(R)$, i.e. the rate of work done on the system, is instead decomposed in two contributions, the rate of electrical $W_{el}(R)$ and mechanical work $W_{mec}(R)$. Following \cite{DROZDOVph}, $W_{el}(R)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
W_{el}(R) = -\int_{\partial R} \Phi\, \dot{\mathbf{H}}\cdot \mathbf{n}
\end{equation}

while $W_{mec}(R)$ reads:
\begin{equation}	
W_{mec}(R) =  \int_{\partial R} \mathbb{S}\mathbf{n} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{u}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}= \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}$ is the displacement vector, which is related to the deformation tensor by $\F=\mathbb{I}-\nabla_0 \mathbf{u}$. Substituting this result back into the formula~(\ref{energyin}) and applying the divergence theorem we obtain the following inequality:
\begin{equation}
\int_R \dot{\psi} - \mathbf{E}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{H}} \, + \, \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \left[e \Phi  z_i \dot{C}_i+ \nabla_0 \left(\mu_i \mathbf{J}_i \right)\right] + \nabla_0 (\mu_s \mathbf{J}_s-\mathbb{S}^T\mathbf{\dot{u}}) \leq 0 
\end{equation}

Since this must hold for any choice of the volume $R$, the inequality must hold also locally:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\psi} - \mathbf{E}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{H}} \, + \, \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \left[e \Phi  z_i \dot{C}_i+ \nabla_0 \left(\mu_i \mathbf{J}_i \right)\right] + \nabla_0 (\mu_s \mathbf{J}_s -\mathbb{S}^T\mathbf{\dot{u}}) \leq 0. 
\end{equation}
Further accounting for Equations~(\ref{consmass})-(\ref{consmom}), we obtain that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\psi} - \mathbf{E}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{H}} \, + \, \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \left[e \Phi  z_i - \mu_i\right] \dot{C}_i - \mu_s \,\dot{C}_s -\mathbb{S}:\dot{\F}+ \sum\limits_{m} \nabla_0 \, \mu_m \cdot \mathbf{J}_m \leq 0.
\label{temp2}
\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}

As exhaustively discussed in previous studies \cite{Plasto,GURTIN}, the energy inequality imposes restrictions on the constitutive equation of the free energy $\psi$. Adapting their results to our specific problem, we have that:
\begin{equation}
\psi = \psi (\F,\F_e, C_s, C_i, \mathbf{H}), \label{temp1}
\end{equation}
which precludes any explicit dependency of $\psi$ on the chemical potential or the viscous deformation gradient $\F_v$. By differentiating the incompressibility condition~(\ref{inc}) and~(\ref{Jv}), we obtain:

\begin{gather}
v_s\dot{C_s} - J \F^{-T}:\dot{\F} =0, \label{temp3}\\
\mathbb{I}:\LL_v=0. \label{temp4}
\end{gather}

If we now substitute~(\ref{temp1}) into~(\ref{temp2}), and include the constraint~(\ref{temp3})-(\ref{temp4}) using as Lagrange multipliers $p$ and $p_v$ respectively, we are left with the augmented form of the energy imbalance inequality:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \color{blue}{\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial C_s}-\mu_s+p v\right)}\color{black}\dot{C}_s+\color{blue}\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mathbf{H}}-\mathbf{E}\right) \cdot \color{black}\dot{\mathbf{H}}+ \sum_i\color{blue}\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial C_i} + e\Phi z_i-\mu_i\right) \color{black}\dot{C}_i \\
+ \color{blue} \left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F} + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial\F_e}\F_v^{-1}- \mathbb{S} - p J \F^{-T}\right): \color{black}\dot{\F}+ \sum_m \nabla_0 \,\mu_m \cdot \mathbf{J}_m \\
- \left(\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}-p_v\mathbb{I}\right):\mathbb{L}_v\leq 0 . \label{ineq}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that in deriving~(\ref{ineq}), we have also made us of the following identity:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\F}=\dot{\F}_e\F_v+\F_e\dot{\F}_v \Longrightarrow \dot{\F}_e=\dot{\F}\F_v^{-1}-\F_e \LL_v.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Construction of the Free Energy.}

Having the general form of $\psi$, Equation~(\ref{temp1}), it remains to construct its precise form. Following a standard approach in $\psi$-depending modeling, we assume that the total free energy can be additively decomposed with each physical mechanisms contributing independently. We here consider five distinct contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
	{\indentitem\item[\textbullet] the energy of the electric field $\psi_1$;}
	{\indentitem \item[\textbullet] the energy of solvent and solutes' molecules not interacting with the solid phase $\psi_2$;}
	{\indentitem\item[\textbullet] the energy of mixing the solid phase with the solution, $\psi_3$;}
	{\indentitem\item[\textbullet] the energy of mixing the solvent with the solutes in solution, $\psi_4$;}
	{\indentitem\item[\textbullet] the energy of the solid phase not interacting with the solution, $\psi_5$.}
\end{enumerate}

Assuming the solid phase to be an ideal and linear dielectric material, with constant permittivity $\epsilon$, the free energy of polarization reads \cite{DROZDOV+,Reviewpolyel}:
\begin{gather}
\psi_1 = \frac{1}{2\epsilon J} \mathbf{H}\F^T \cdot \F \mathbf{H}.
\end{gather}

The specific energy density $\psi_2$ has the standard form:
\begin{equation}
\psi_2 = \sum\limits_{m} \mu^0_m C_m
\end{equation} 
where $\mu^0_m$ denotes the chemical potential of non interacting solvent and ions molecules. According to Flory-Huggins theory \cite{flory,hug} of mixtures, the mixing energy is given by:
\begin{equation}
\psi_3 = \frac{k_B T J}{v_s} \left(\phi_f \ln \phi_f + \chi \phi_f \phi_n\right),\label{mix}
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature and $\chi$ is the Flory-Huggins parameter, which is a measure of the enthalpy of mixing. Note that Xue et al.\cite{ecm1,ecm2} use a different approach. In these studies, the authors assume only the mixing of GAGs with solvent, while neglecting the collagen. Since we are considering GAGs and the collagen network as as a unique solid phase and we could not find any evidence that collagen does not mix with water, we have chosen the more general form~(\ref{mix}).

As the interstitial fluid is well approximated by a dilute solution, the contribution $\psi_4$ reads \cite{Reviewpolyel,ecm1,ecm2}:

\begin{equation}
\psi_4 = k_B T \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} C_i \left(\ln \frac{C_i}{ C_s}-1\right).
\end{equation}

Finally, we need to specify the strain energy $\psi_5$ which depends on the particular constitutive model used to describe the material. As mentioned in the Introduction the Standard Linear Solid (SLS), see Figure \ref{SLS}, is commonly used to describe soft material in the regime of small deformation. However, when account for large deformation, as in the case of swelling, soft material present a non-linear behaviour \cite{floryprinciples}. For this reason we consider the model in Figure \ref{fig1A}, which is a generalization of the 1D SLS to 3D problems with non-linear elastic response.

\end{figure}

The strain energy can thus be decomposed into the sum of the contributions from spring $1$ and spring $2$:

\begin{equation}
\psi_6 = \psi_{5.1}(\F) + \psi_{5.2}(\F_e).
\end{equation}

As in \cite{ecm2}, we consider the spring to be isotropic and hyper-elastic (Neo-Hookean) which are characterised by the following form of the free-energy:

\begin{eqnarray}
\psi_{5.1}(\F) = \frac{G^A_1}{2} \left(\F:\F - 3 -2 \ln J\right)\\
\psi_{5.2}(\F_e) = \frac{G^A_2}{2} \left(\F_e:\F_e - 3 -2 \ln J_{e}\right)\label{hyp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $G_{1/2}$ stands for the shear modulus associated with each spring, $J_e= \det \F_e$, while $J$ is as defined in the previous sections. As derived in \cite{floryprinciples}, the hyper-elastic model~(\ref{hyp}) can be correlated to the microscopic properties of a polymer network, under the assumption of Gaussian chains and affine deformation. Other thermodynamically consistent form of the stretching energy have been proposed in the literature \cite{BERGSTROM1998931,boyce2,doi}. These have been also derived by statistical arguments but starting from different network models.

\subsection{Entropy Production $\sigma$.}
\label{ent}

Having specified how the system interacts with its environment, we can now discuss how it dissipates energy. As mentioned in Section~(\ref{kin}), there are two contributions: transport (diffusion of solvent and solutes) and viscosity. The thermodynamic fluxes \footnote{See Section \ref{secNET}} associated with these two phenomena are $\mathbf{J}_m$, $m=s,1,\ldots,N$, and $\LL_v$. Consequently, using Equation~(\ref{2law}), we obtain:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sum_m \zeta_m \cdot \mathbf{J}_m + \zeta_v : \LL_v,
\label{dis}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta$s represent the thermodynamic forces associate with each flux. On the other hand, $\dot{C}_s$, $\dot{C}_i$, $\mathbf{\dot{H}}$ and $\dot{\F}$ describe the evolution of reversible process. This implies that their value can be controlled and arbitrarily chosen, by carefully tune the condition of an experiment, i.e. tuning boundary and initial conditions. In order for the energy imbalance inequality~(\ref{ineq}) to always hold, and given the constraint~(\ref{temp1}) on $\psi$, this can only happen if the terms highlighted in blue in Equation~(\ref{ineq}) are identically zero. As shown in the Appendix \ref{stateequation}, this leads to the following system of state equations:
\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
\mu_s = p v_s + \mu_s^0 + k_BT&\left[\ln \frac{C_s v_s}{1+C_s v_s} + \frac{1}{1+C_sv_s}\right.\\
&\left.\ \ \ \ \ \ +\frac{\chi}{(1+C_s v_s)^2}-\sum_i \frac{C_i}{C_s}\right], 
\end{aligned}\label{gov1}\\[2.5mm]
\mu_i = \mu^0_i + e\Phi z_i + kT \ln \frac{C_i}{C_s},\label{mu}\\
\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon J} \F^T \F\, \mathbf{H}\, , \qquad -\epsilon J \nabla^2 \Phi = Q\, ,\label{sys2}
\end{gather}
\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{T}= -p \mathbb{I}+ \frac{G^A_1}{1+C_sv_s}\left(\mathbb{B}-\mathbb{I}\right) + \frac{G^A_2}{1+C_sv_s}\left(\mathbb{B}_e-\mathbb{I}\right) \\
+ \underbrace{\epsilon \left[\frac{1}{2} \,|\nabla \Phi|^2\mathbb{I} -\nabla \Phi \otimes \nabla \Phi\right]}_{\mathbb{T}^{Max}},
\end{aligned}
\label{sys3}
\end{gather}
where $T^{max}$ is the component of the stress tensor due to the presence of the electric field. As discussed in Section \ref{secNET}, in the framework of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, when considering isothermal transformation, the second law of thermodynamics can be rewrite as Equations~(\ref{eqCIT}). Using the same argument as in Section \ref{sec_ine} and Equation~(\ref{dis}), we can rewrite Equations~(\ref{eqCIT}) in differential form, and substituting Equations~(\ref{gov1})-(\ref{sys3}), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\sigma = -  \sum_m \frac{1}{T}\nabla_0 \,\mu_m \cdot \mathbf{J}_m + \frac{1}{T}\left( \F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}-p_v\mathbb{I}\right):\mathbb{L}_v\label{EQen}
\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}

Equating Equation~(\ref{EQen}) and~(\ref{dis}), it is evident that the thermodynamics forces are:
\begin{gather}
\zeta_m = \frac{1}{T} \nabla_0 \,\mu_m, \label{vflow1}\\
\zeta_v = \frac{1}{T} \left( \F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}-p_v\mathbb{I}\right) = \frac{1}{T} \left[G^A_2(\mathbb{C}_e-\mathbb{I})-p_v\mathbb{I}\right].
\end{gather}
Assuming to be in regime of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we can use the identity~(\ref{lin}) to couple fluxes and forces. However, considering the symmetry constraint from \textit{Curie's law}\footnote{Macroscopic causes can not have more element of symmetries than the effect they cause \cite{CIT}} , there can be no coupling between fluxes and forces of different tensorial nature. Consequently, we are left with the following force-flux relation:
\begin{gather}
\LL_v = L_{vv} \zeta_v,\label{vflow2}\\
\mathbf{J}_m = \sum_{k=s,1,\ldots,N} L_{mk} \zeta_k. \label{dif}
\end{gather}

%Combining Equation~(\ref{vflow1}) and (\ref{vflow2}), and imposing that condition~(\ref{Jv}) is satisfied, we can characterise the viscous flow by the following relation:
%\begin{equation}
%\LL_v = L_{vv}T^{-1}\text{DEV}\left[\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}\right] = \eta^{-1}\text{DEV}\left[\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}\right] ,
%\end{equation}
%where $\eta$ represent the viscosity of the material and $\text{DEV}\left[\cdot\right] = \cdot-1/3\, \text{tr}(\cdot)$ is the deviatoric component of the tensor in the brackets. 

%The dissipative contribution due to the relative movement of phases has been largely studied in the literature \cite{ecm1,ecm2}. Starting from Equation~(\ref{dif}) and standard arguments we can get to the following definition for the fluxes:
As described in Appendix \ref{apenergy}, starting from Equations~(\ref{vflow1})-(\ref{dif}) and with common consideration from the theory of mixture, we can derive the following system of time dependent equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_t C_s=\nabla_0 \cdot\left[K C_s \F^{-1}\left(c_s\nabla \mu_s +\sum_i \frac{D_i}{D^0_i} c_i \nabla \mu_i\right)\right],\label{gov2}\\
\partial_t C_i= \nabla_0\cdot\left[\frac{D_i}{k_B T}C_i\F^{-1}\nabla \mu_i -\frac{D_i}{D^0_i} \frac{C_i}{C_s} \mathbf{J}_s\right],\label{gov3} \\
\dot{\mathbb{B}}_e =\LL\mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - \frac{1}{\tau_R} \,\mathbb{B}_e\text{DEV}[\mathbb{B}_e].\label{Be}
\end{eqnarray}
where the parameters (see the Glossary) are macroscopic phenomenological coefficients, that can either be estimated experimentally or derived from the nano/microscopic properties of the different phases \cite{ecm1,ecm2}. To sum up the governing equations for the Model A are Equations~(\ref{gov1})-(\ref{sys3}) together with the flow rules~(\ref{gov2})-(\ref{Be}). The analogous system of equation for model B can be found in Appendix \ref{modelB}.
