\section{Introduction}

In tissues, cells are mainly surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM), a soft porous media mixed with interstitial fluid and made up of networks of polymer chains and charged proteins. \textit{In vitro} studies have shown that ECM rigidity and shear stresses due to the flow of interstitial fluid can promote malignant phenotypes in a population of initially normal cells, impact on cell proliferation and differentiation \cite{ex3}. Further experiments have shown that tumour development is often associated with a stiffening of the tissue compared to the surrounding healthy one \cite{ex4}. This causes cells to be exposed to higher compressive stresses and the blood vessels to collapse, thus impeding the diffusion of substances in the extra-cellular environment. Hence, numerous therapies are less effective \cite{ecm2}. Based on such evidence, it is now widely accepted that, unlike originally thought, biological process are not simply regulated by biochemical signals but by the complex interplay of mechanical and chemical stimuli.
 
Given the different physical nature and scale of phenomena involved, coupling micro-environment and cell behaviours is a problem of high complexity. This requires understanding processes occurring at different temporal and spatial scales and how they interplay to determine the macroscopic behaviour of a tissue, whether healthy or damaged. Despite experiments probing the micro-scale are nowadays possible, these are usually limited to controlled environment in contrast to \textit{in vivo} conditions. On the other hand, we can easily measure macroscopic properties of tissue. Hence, we need quantitative models able to link this tissue to cellular scale, so to extrapolate from the data information the environment cell perceive. In order for this to be possible, alongside experiments, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework able to capture both the biology and physics involved and which is consistent with the known universal laws of Nature \cite{NET}. Having such knowledge on the cell micro-environment can lead to the development of novel therapies and completely change our approach to drug design.  

As it will be discussed in Section \ref{ECMcomp}, the ECM can be classified as polyelectrolyte gel \cite{ecm1,ecm2}, i.e. hydrogels with charged group. Besides being largely present in the natural world, synthetic polyelectrolytes are currently employed for a wide range of applications, such as drug delivery, biomedical devices, scaffolds for tissue engineering and soft robotics \cite{hydroex3,hydroex2,hydroex1,hydroex4}. Hence, there has been a growing interest in the soft matter community in understanding their behaviour and translating it into mathematical models. In particular, research has been focusing on the phenomena of swelling, i.e. large deformation due to absorption of water, and the diffusion transport and release of solution \cite{DROZDOV+,DROZDOVph,Reviewpolyel,swell2}.

With the development of new experimental techniques such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), the local mechanical properties of a material can be measured with nanometre precision \cite{viscoporo}. When tested at this scale, soft tissues, as well as hydrogels, have been found to be visco-elastic \cite{ex5}. As their solid skeleton, i.e. polymer network, is deformed, it can change its conformation to a most entropically favourable one thus dissipating energy. Where purely elastic solids deformed instantaneously, viscoelastic materials instead have time-dependent deformation due to the irreversible nature of the process. 
Despite these experimental evidences, theoretical studies on visco-elastic soft materials remain limited. Most of the literature has been proposing poro-elastic models, which account for the dissipation of energy due to the transport of solutions but neglect the visco-elastic response of the material itself \cite{Article1}. While this assumption might be valid for certain applications, the empirical studies previously mentioned highlight the need of including this component in the study of living tissues. 

Our works aims to develop a continuum mathematical model of the extracellular matrix which is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, which accounts for its poro-visco-elastic properties and the coupling of mechanical, transport and electrical phenomena. Nonetheless, our results are more widely applicable to the study of polyelectrolyte gels. At our present knowledge, there is no previous work in the literature capturing all these aspects in a thermodynamic consistent model. In \cite{ecm1,ecm2} Xue et al.~ develop a nonlinear poroelastic theory for ECM, which couples all three physical phenomena but does not include viscous dissipation. In \cite{Jeru}, the authors couple mechano-electrophysiological effects including the viscous dissipation but neglect transport; Caccavo et al.~ \cite{Article1} propose a poro-viscoelastic model for neutral hydrogel, thus excluding electrical effects. Following these previous work, we will derive our model in the framework of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics \cite{NET} accounting for multiple phases.

As discussed in \cite{viscoporo}, there are spatial and time scales which allow to decouple visco-elasticity and poro-elasticity. On one hand, nanoscale rheological testing with AFM give us information on the visco-elastic properties of the sample. For sufficiently small beads, the length scale considered in the experiment is so short that poroelastic relaxation is almost instantaneous and thus negligible. Different 1D rheological model are usually applied to fit experimental measurement: the most common for tissues and hydrogels is the \textit{Standard Linear Solid} model, see Figure \ref{SLS}, to fit the experimental data \cite{Article1,viscoporo}. The poro-elastic behaviour can instead be characterized by standard creep-relaxation test on whole sample. In this case, Darcy's law is usually applied to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and thus characterise the transport of fluid in the material \cite{Netti,viscoporo}. Despite having a good understanding of the two phenomena independently, there has been little attention to investigating how the two couples. Following a typical approach in the framework of large deformation, we will be using a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient to account for the two phenomena simultaneously.

In the framework of large deformation, a standard approach to the study of couple phenomena is the use of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. We will be rely on the same idea to build our poro-visco-elatic model. In the literature of soft matter, two possible decomposition have been proposed, based on arbitrary choice, but never systematically compared. As our analysis shows, multiplicative decomposition should be treated as constitutive laws of the material and thus validated  and compared. Instead of arbitrarily choosing one of the two, we here develop both approaches, with the aim of identifying their differences and investigating experimental result which would allow us to experimentally test which one best describes the behaviour of soft tissues. 

Our work is organized as follows: in Section \ref{ECMcomp}, we discuss more in details the composition of the ECM. We then present a brief overview of Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics, which focuses on the principles later used in the derivation of the model. Following previous studies, two possible decomposition of the deformation tensor are proposed. The two approaches are then compared in Section \ref{eqtest}. Our study shows the need of introducing experimental validation of the tensor decomposition, which should be regard as a constitutive assumption and not simply a mathematical formulation. While being not relevant to poroelastic model, this is an important aspect when visco-elastic effect which should be consider before any further analysis of the dynamical properties of the system.
