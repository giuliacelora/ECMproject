\begin{abstract}
In tissues, cells are mainly surrounded by an extracellular matrix (ECM), a soft porous media mixed with interstitial fluid and made up of networks of polymer chains and charged protein. It is known that the physical and biochemical properties of the ECM play a role in determining cell behaviour. While many studies have focused on linking the elastic properties of the ECM, less effort has been put in understanding the effect of its viscous properties on cell response. In this work, a non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory is developed to describe the chemo-mechanical behaviour of the ECM, which is modelled as a poro-visco-elastic polyelectrolyte. By using classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics we derive a set of governing equations for the transport of interstitial fluid and the time-dependent deformation of the ECM. Two different constitutive models are proposed which differ in how elastic and viscous deformation are coupled. An experimental protocol is then proposed with the aim of validating and selecting the proper model for the ECM.

\input{introduction}

\section{Composition of Extracellular Matrix.}
\label{ECMcomp}
Despite the tissue-specific nature of extracellular matrix (ECM), this is usually composed of a network of collagen fibrils entangled with proteoglycans (PGAs) which are covalently bonded to charged chains of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), see Figure \ref{ECMfig_a}.  While collagen is mainly responsible for the mechanical behaviour of the tissue, GAGs can imbibe water, giving the extracellular matrix the ability to swell while maintaining its structural integrity. As mentioned in the introduction, from this point of view, the ECM is a polyelectrolyte gel. As schematically illustrated in Figure \ref{ECMfig}(b), polyelectrolyte gels are 3D networks of cross-linked polymer chains that contain ionizable functional groups. When in solution the gel swells, while the functional groups dissociate into fixed charges and mobile ions in the solution. In particular, research has been focusing on the phenomena of swelling, i.e. large deformation due to the absorption of water, and the transport and release of a solution  \cite{DROZDOV+,DROZDOVph,Reviewpolyel,swell2}.

	\label{ECMfig}
\end{figure}

For the purpose of this study, we will not explicitly distinguish between collagen, PGAs and GAGs. At the tissue level, this can be grouped into a single solid phase (the polymer network), whose mechanical properties are treated as the average over the different component contributions. The interstitial fluid is instead treated as a two-phase solution: the solvent (i.e. water) and the solutes (free ions). The transport of the solution also contributes to the dissipation of energy due to frictional forces generated by the relative motion of the different phases.

As is common in multiphase models of tissue, we will assume that the matrix is isotropic and GAGs are evenly distributed on the network. While this is not a good approximation for tissue like cartilage, which are highly anisotropic, it does apply to the extracellular matrix found in soft tissues such as liver, brain and tumours. It is also important to point out that the ECM has additional properties such as thermo-sensitivity and pH-sensitivity. However, both in living organisms and in experimental set-up temperature and pH are maintained fairly constant.

\section{Non Equilibrium Thermodynamics.}
\label{secNET}
As mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in studying the deformation of the ECM and the transport of solution in it. Since these are irreversible processes, they can not be described in the framework of equilibrium thermodynamics. 

In the case of irreversible processes, the change in the entropy of a system $\d S$ results from both the reversible exchange of energy and matter with the external environment $\d_eS$ and the internal dissipation of energy during the process $\d_iS$ \cite{NET}:
\begin{equation}
\d S = \d_eS + \d_iS, 
\end{equation}
According to the second law of thermodynamics, which applies universally to any system or any of its sub-parts $\d_i S\ge 0$. It is important to notice that the second law allows transformations in which total change in entropy $d S$ of the system is negative. This occurs whenever $\|\d_e S\|>\d_i S$, with $\d_e S <0$, and it can lead to the spontaneous formation of complex and ordered structures such as living organisms. From this point of view, life emerges in physics as an efficient mechanism able to increase sufficiently the entropy of its environment \cite{JeremyEngland}.  

In this study, we will focus on isothermal processes, i.e. $T=const$, as this well approximates physiological conditions well. Under this assumption, as derived by Gurtin in \cite{GURTIN}, the second law of thermodynamics is equivalent to the following \textit{energy imbalance inequality}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\d}{\d t} \left\{\int_R \psi \right\}\leq W(R) + M(R), \label{energyin}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is an arbitrary control volume of the system, $\psi$ is the Helmholtz free energy, $W(R)$ is the rate at which the environment does work on $R$ and $M(R)$ is the inflow of mass due to transport. It is important to note that, as long as the quantities involved are well defined, the energy inequality~(\ref{energyin}) holds for any isothermal process independently of the specific physical system considered. This imposes a constraint on the form of the function $\psi$ and its dependence on the other thermodynamic variables, such as temperature or pressure, which are used to describe the system. 

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics mainly focuses on defining the form of $\d_i S$, which, unlike the reversible entropy production $\d_e S$, is not a state variable but depends on the specific transformation applied to the system. 
Different theories have been proposed, \cite{NET}, each with its assumptions and specific domain of applicability. In our study we will focus on \textquotedblleft Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics'' (CIT) which was pioneered by Onsager \cite{onsager} and Prigogine \cite{prigogine} in the first half of the 20th century. One the most important assumptions of this theory is the \textit{Local Equilibrium Hypothesis}, which guarantees thermodynamic variables, including entropy, are locally well-defined, \cite{NET}. 
Consequently, we can introduce the entropy density $s=s(\mathbf{x},t)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
S = \int_{R} s \,\d V, \qquad \d s = \d_e s + \d_is, \qquad \d_is > 0, 
\end{equation}
and the local entropy production:
\begin{equation}
\sigma \equiv \frac{\d_i s}{\d t} \geq 0.
\end{equation}

Another central aspect of the theory is the introduction of \textit{thermodynamic forces} \footnote{Not to be intended in the mechanical sense} $\zeta_m$ (causes) and \textit{thermodynamic fluxes} $J_m$ (effects) to describe the time evolution of the system during an irreversible transformation. These are related to $\sigma$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sum_m \zeta_m J_m\geq 0.
\label{2law}
\end{equation}

While the local equilibrium hypothesis is at the basis of most theories of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the following two hypotheses uniquely identify CIT:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] \textit{Linear Relation between forces $\zeta$ and fluxes $J$}:
	\begin{equation}
	J_m = \sum_k L_{mk} \zeta_k,\label{lin}
	\end{equation}
	where the constant $L_{mk}$ are referred to as \textbf{phenomenological coefficients};
	\item[2.] \textit{Microscopic Reversibility}: time reversibility of processes at the micro-scale. 
\end{itemize}

Starting from these two principles, in his seminal paper \cite{onsager} Onsager derives the well-known \textit{Onsager Reciprocal Relation}:
\begin{equation}
L_{mk}=L_{km}.
\end{equation}

If we now consider an isothermal transformation in the framework of CIT, alongside with the energy imbalance inequality, we have that the following must hold:

\begin{equation}
W(R)+M(R)-\frac{\d}{\d t} \left\{\int_R \psi \right\} = T \int_R \sigma \,\d V\, ,
\label{eqCIT}
\end{equation}

In the past few decades, CIT has been applied successfully to the modelling of several physical phenomena of interest for engineers, physicists and applied mathematicians. However, its validity is limited to phenomena near-equilibrium, for which a linear approximation of the flux-force relation holds. The growing interest in more complex far-from-equilibrium phenomena has pushed toward the development of a more general framework for the study of non-equilibrium phenomena. Since this goes beyond the purpose of our study, we will not discuss it further. We do, however, highlight the law of steepest entropy ascent, which, according to Beretta \cite{SEA2}, seems to emerge as the fourth fundamental law of nature. In the linear regime, this principle can be used to prove Onsager's reciprocal relation \cite{SEA1}, with no reference to the microscopic reversibility hypothesis, whose validity remains instead controversial \cite{CIT}.

\section{Model Development}
\label{modeldev}
\subsection{Conservation Law.}
\label{conslaw}
As mentioned in Section \ref{ECMcomp}, we here consider the ECM as a three-phase medium composed of a solid polymer network with fixed charges, a solvent (i.e. water molecules, interstitial fluid) and solutes (freely moving charges). 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{0.9\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/deformation.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Sketch of the dry and current state of the ECM network.}
	\label{Above}
\end{figure}

As the tissue deforms, the material element originally located at $\mathbf{X}$ in the initial configuration $\mathcal{B}_0$ is displaced to the point $\mathbf{x}$ in the current configuration $\mathcal{B}_t$, see Figure \ref{Above}. Such a transformation is described by the deformation gradient tensor $\F= \partial \mathbf{x}/\partial \mathbf{X}$; the information about the change in ECM volume is encoded in $J= \det \F$, while $\mathbf{u}= \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}$ is the displacement vector. As in \cite{sarah}, we consider the reference, or initial, state $\mathcal{B}_0$, which is stress free, to be equivalent to the dry state of the ECM, i.e. only solid phase present. Since we assume the solid phase to be incompressible, any change in the volume can only be related to the migration of solvent and solute molecules, whose nominal \footnote{variable value in the reference configuration.} concentrations will be denoted by $C_s$ and $C_i$ respectively, $i=1,\ldots,N$ with $N$ being the number of free ion species. This lead to the molecular incompressibility condition:

\begin{equation}
 J= 1 + v_s C_s +\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} v_i C_i,
 \label{comp}
\end{equation}
where $v_m$ are the characteristic molecular volume of each species in the solution. When considering the interstitial fluid, the contribution of ions to the volume can be neglected \cite{ecm1,ecm2} so that Equation~(\ref{comp}) reduces to:

\begin{equation}
J=1+v_s C_s.
\label{inc}
\end{equation} 

Consequently, the volume fractions of fluid $\phi_f$ and solid $\phi_n$ phases in the swollen ECM are defined as:
\begin{equation}
\phi_f = \frac{v_sC_s}{1+v_sC_s}, \qquad \phi_n = \frac{1}{1+v_sC_s}.
\end{equation}
where again we are neglecting the contribution of ions to the total volume.
While $C_m$ denotes the number of each molecule per unit volume in the initial configuration for the $m$-th species in the solution, the actual concentration in the current state is denoted by $c_m=C_m/J$. Throughout the derivation of the model, we will be using the index $i=1,\ldots,N$ to denote the ionic species only, while $m\in\left\{s,1,\ldots,N\right\}$ refers to all mobile species, i.e. both the solvent and solutes.

Mass conservation must apply to all mobile species and in the initial configuration this reads:
\begin{equation}
\dot{C}_m + \nabla_0 \cdot \mathbf{J}_m = 0, \label{consmass}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{J}_m$ is the nominal flux per unit area in the dry state, $\dot{C}_m$ is the derivative of $C_m$ with respect to time, i.e.  $\dot{C}_m\equiv\partial_t C_m$ and $\nabla_0$ denotes the gradient in the Lagrangian coordinates $\mathbf{X}$. Their counterparts in the actual configuration are denoted by $\mathbf{j}_m$ and $\nabla$ and are defined according to the following rules:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{J}_m = J \F^{-1} \mathbf{j}_m, \qquad \nabla_0 (\cdot) = \F^{T} \nabla(\cdot).
\end{equation}

When considering tissues or hydrogels, inertial and gravitational effects are commonly neglected, so that the conservation of momentum for the ECM reads:

\begin{gather}
\nabla_0 \cdot \mathbb{S}=0\label{consmom},
\end{gather}

where $\mathbb{S}$ is the first Piola-Kirchoff tensor, which represents the stress state of the ECM in the initial configuration. The counterpart in the current configuration is the Cauchy stress tensor $\mathbb{T}$, which is related to $\mathbb{S}$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{T} = J^{-1}\mathbb{S}\F^T.\label{TS}
\end{equation}

The presence of free moving ions generates an electric field which is denoted by $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{e}$ in the initial and current configuration respectively. Introducing the electrostatic potential $\Phi$, we have that:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}= -\nabla_0 \, \Phi, \hspace{8mm} \mathbf{e}= - \nabla \, \Phi.
\label{Phi}
\end{equation}

As in \cite{Reviewpolyel}, we consider the matrix to be a dielectric material\footnote{a material that does not conduct electricity but can be polarized in the presence of an electric field.}. Consequently, the presence of the electric field generates an electric displacement $\mathbf{H}$\footnote{the vector field that accounts for both the electric field and the polarization of the dielectric material.}, which must obey Gauss law of electrostatics:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_0 \cdot \mathbf{H}= Q,
\label{gauss}
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the local total charge, which accounts for both fixed and moving charges:
\begin{equation}
Q = e\left(\sum\limits_{i} z_i C_i+z_f C_{f}\right)\, , \label{Q}
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $C_f$ is the concentration of fix charges and $z_m$ is the valence of the corresponding charged species. Note that $C_f$ here corresponds to the concentration of GAGs, which is assumed to be a constant a fraction of $C_s$. As for above, we can move from nominal quantities to the corresponding value in the current configuration by applying the following rules:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{H} = J \mathbf{h}\F^{-T},\\
\mathbf{E} = \F^T \mathbf{e},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{h}$ is the electric displacement in the current configuration.

\subsection{Kinematics.}
\label{kin}

As mentioned in the introduction, we model the ECM as a poro-visco-elastic material. As shown in Figure \ref{deformation}, there are two molecular processes that give rise to the macroscopic time-dependent response of the system: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item [1.] the rearrangements of molecules at the micro-scale,  which has entropic origin and results in a volume-preserving viscous deformation;
	\item[2.] the long range transport of fluid that leads to swelling, i.e. changes in the ECM's size, and give rise to frictional forces between phases. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\def\svgwidth{1.0\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/visco_poro.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Illustration of the molecular processes which account for the macroscopic deformation of ECM: viscosity is related to changes in the conformation of the network which preserve the volume of the network.}
	\label{deformation}
\end{figure}

In order to capture both phenomena, as common in the large-deformation theory \cite{Plasto,Article1,CACCAVO2,magneto,NGUYEN,growthtum} and first proposed by Kr\"{o}ner in 1960 \cite{kro}, we consider a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation tensor $\F$. As this can be chosen arbitrary, different decomposition have been proposed in the literature. These corresponds to different constitutive assumptions on the time-dependent response of the material to deformation. For the purpose of this study, we consider the two most commonly used, which will be here denoted as model A \cite{Plasto,Article1,CACCAVO2} and model B \cite{Jeru,magneto,NGUYEN}:

\begin{gather}
\text{MODEL A} \Rightarrow\begin{cases}
\F=\F_e\F_v,\\
\det\F_v=1, \quad \det\F_e=\det\F,
\end{cases} \label{dec1}\tag{A}\\[4pt]
\text{MODEL B} \Rightarrow\begin{cases}
\F= \bar{\F}\F_{vol}=\bar{\F}_e\bar{\F}_v\F_{vol},\\
\det\F=\det\F_{vol},\quad \det\bar{\F}=\det\bar{\F}_e=\det\bar{\F}_v=1.\label{dec2}
\end{cases}\tag{B}
\end{gather}

To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous systematic study in the literature that compares these two approaches. While the two model are identical in the case of iso-volumetric deformation, i.e. $\det \F=J=1$, this is not always the case when a tissue swells, as it will be shown in Section~(\ref{data}).

For the purpose of the model derivation, we will derive in the main text only the governing equations for model A. The derivation of model B is analogous provided just minor changes, which are discussed in Appendix \ref{modelB}.

\label{Model2}
\end{figure}

Focusing on System~(\ref{dec1}), we identify $\F_e$ as the elastic contribution to the deformation while, the term $\F_v$ accounts for the viscous flow. As illustrated in Figure \ref{Model2}, the multiplicative decomposition is equivalent to introducing an intermediate configuration $\mathcal{B}_v$, called the natural or virtual configuration. The evolution of the natural configuration can be interpreted as an entropy producing, i.e. dissipative process. On the other hand, in the elastic deformation from the natural to the current configuration, all the energy is stored in the system. 

Deriving Equation~(\ref{dec1}) with respect to time, we have that:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\F}=\dot{\F}_e\F_v+\F_e\dot{\F}_v \Longrightarrow \dot{\F}_e=\dot{\F}\F_v^{-1}-\F_e \LL_v. \label{lv}
\end{equation}
where $\LL_v=\dot{\F}_v\F_v^{-1}$ is the viscous velocity gradient tensor. These can be decomposed into its symmetric $\mathbb{D}$ and skewed $\mathbb{W}$ part:

\begin{equation}
\LL_v = \mathbb{D}_v + \mathbb{W}_v,  \ \ \mathbb{D}_v = \frac{\LL_v+\LL^T_v}{2}, \ \ \mathbb{W}_v = \frac{\LL_v-\LL^T_v}{2}.
\end{equation}

The decomposition~(\ref{dec1}) is not unique, as stress state in $\mathcal{B}_v$ would not change under any arbitrary rigid-body rotation \cite{multdec}. As suggested by \cite{Plasto}, in the case of an isotropic material, it is reasonable to assume the viscous flow to be irrotational, i.e. $\mathbb{W}_v=\mathbb{O}$, so that $\LL_v \equiv \mathbb{D}_v$.
As mentioned before, the physical nature of the viscous deformation is molecular rearrangement so that volume is preserved. This requires us to introduce the additional constraint:
\begin{equation}
J_v=\det \F_v= 1.\label{Jv}
\end{equation}

\section{Elasticity: Equilibrium Behaviour.}
\label{eqtest}
As common in the literature of polyelectrolytes modelling, we study our models in two different settings: free and compressed swelling. Despite considering equilibrium conditions, these experiments allow us to estimate a subset of the many parameter in the model. As we will see also in this simplified setting where the dynamics is neglected important differences emerges between the two model presented, which result in relevant quantitative discrepancy in the predictions. Our aim is thus to understand which experiments are necessary in order the most appropriate model to describe a soft material.

Throughout this section, unless specified otherwise, we will be using the parameters listed in Table \ref{Tab1} in Appendix \ref{para}.

\subsection{Unconstrained Free Swelling.} 
\label{free}

First of all, we study the unconstrained free swelling of a cuboid slice of ECM when immersed in a bath of interstitial fluid. For simplicity we consider that the latter contains only two species of free ions: a positive $C_+$ and a negative $C_-$ one. We further assume the bath to be well-mixed and stress-free with both pressure and electric potential identically zero. Given $2c_0$ to be the total concentration of free ions in the neutral bath, $c_0$ denotes the concentration of each ionic species. As the system evolves, proper boundary conditions require the  continuity of chemical potentials and stresses across the boundary:
\begin{equation}
\left[\mu_s\right]^+_-=\left[\mu_+\right]^+_-=\left[\mu_-\right]^+_-=0, \quad \left[\mathbf{n} \mathbb{T}\mathbf{n}\right]^+_-=0.
\end{equation}
with $[\cdot]^+_-$ denoting the change in the value of a variable across the tissue boundary.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{0.9\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/freeswell.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Schematic representation of a free swelling. Since we are considering an isotropic mixture, the ECM maintains its shape while all dimension are stretched of the same amount $\lambda$. So that the relative volume change is $\delta V = \lambda^3-1$. }
\end{figure}

An additional boundary condition is necessary due to the second-order derivatives in $\Phi$ in Equation~(\ref{sys2}). Unlike the other variables, the electrostatic potential in the ECM rapidly change near the boundary. This creates a thin charged interface \cite{swell2}. Since its thickness is negligible compared to the size of the ECM, we consider $\Phi$ to be discontinuous at the interface, while the associated stress $\mathbb{T}^{Max}$ vanishes on the boundary:
\begin{equation}
\left.\nabla \Phi \cdot \mathbf{n}\right|_-= 0.
\end{equation}

As the tissue is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous, the deformation gradient tensor $\F$ reads:
\begin{equation}
\F= \lambda \mathbb{I},\label{deffree}                                                                
\end{equation}
with the stretch $\lambda=(1+C_s v_s)^{1/3}$. Following \cite{DROZDOVph}, the equilibrium state is characterized by the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] chemical potentials of solvent and solutes are homogeneous and equal in the bath and in the tissue:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\mu_s=\mu^{ext}_s = \mu^0_s - vkT \sum_i c^i_0 ,\\\label{free1}
	\mu_i=\mu^{ext}_i = \mu^0_i +kT\ln(v_sc^i_0).\label{freeend}
	\end{eqnarray} 
	\item[2.] $\Phi$ is constant in the tissue so that $\nabla \Phi \equiv \mathbf{0}$ in the interior of the domain.
	\item[3.] The stress tensor $\mathbb{T}$ is constant and equal to the value in the bath:
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{T}=0.\label{free2}
	\end{equation} 
\end{itemize}

As shown in Appendix \ref{apfree}, imposing the equilibrium conditions, we obtain that for both models the equilibrium stretch $\lambda$ is implicitly defined by the following algebraic equation:
\begin{gather}
\textstyle 
F(\lambda)=\dfrac{\lambda^3+\chi}{\lambda^6}+\dfrac{p v_s}{k_BT}+\ln \dfrac{\lambda^3-1}{\lambda^3} +2c_0v_s-\sqrt{\left(\frac{z_fC_fv_s}{\lambda^3-1}\right)^2+4v_s^2c^2_0} =0, \label{eqF}
\end{gather}
where the pressure $p$ is defined depending on the model considered as:
\begin{equation}
p = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{G^A_{eq}}{\lambda^3}(\lambda^2-1)\qquad \text{MODEL A},\\[10pt]
\dfrac{G^B_{vol}}{\lambda^3}(\lambda^2-1)\qquad \text{MODEL B},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
with $G^A_{eq}=G^A_1+G^A_2$. In this case, both models reduce to the standard hyper-elastic model for polyelectrolytes proposed by Hong \cite{Reviewpolyel}. As this has been previously discussed in the literature, we only present its most important features. As illustrated in Figure \ref{analysis}, the ion concentration $c_0$ affects the degree of swelling. However it is the mixing parameter $\chi$ which defined the tissue phase. This can either be in a highly swollen or a collapsed phase, where the latter is characterised by low absorption of fluid \cite{swell2}.

%As the two models are equivalent, we conclude that common unconstrained swelling experiments are not sufficient to discern between them. On the other hand, fitting Equation~(\ref{eqF}) to the data collected is useful to estimate some of the parameters in the model.

\section{State Equation for Model A.}
\label{stateequation}
Thermodynamics theory describe the state of a system in terms of primitive physical quantities \cite{GURTIN}. As shown in Table~(\ref{ind}), this can be divided into independent and dependent variables. While the fist are the variables of the model, the second are uniquely defined as a function of the independent variables, i.e. a \textit{state equation}. This are of the form: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}(C_m,\F,\mathbf{H},\F_e,\mu_m,\mathbb{M}_e,\nabla \mu_m),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{E}$ can be replaced by any dependent variable. The split between dependent and independent variables is usually arbitrary, but it comes natural when looking at the energy inequality.

\vspace{3mm}
\caption{Constitutive Variables.}
\label{ind}
\end{table}

When considering independent variables, this can be further split into the one that describe a reversible and an irreversible process. Depending on the system properties the latter can be associated with thermodynamic force (see Section \ref{secNET}). Note that, the rate of change, i.e. time derivative, of reversible variables does not appear in the list of constitutive variables. This is because the state of a system during a reversible (ideal) transformation depend only on the current value of the thermodynamic variable and not at the rate at which they change\cite{NET}.
This has two main consequence: the value of the rate variables $\Gamma$ (see Glossary or Section \ref{ent}) can be chosen arbitrarily by setting the proper experimental condition, and the energy imbalance inequality~(\ref{ineq}) is linear in this terms. Consequently, we have that in order for the energy imbalance inequality to hold for any arbitrary choice of $\Gamma$, the term in the blue brackets of Equation~(\ref{ineq}) must be identically zero: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu &=& \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial C}+ p v_s,\\[2mm]
\mathbf{E} &=& \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mathbf{H}},\\[2mm]
\mu_i &=& e\Phi z_i + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial C_i},\\[2mm]
\mathbb{S} &=&  \dfrac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F} + \dfrac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}\F_v^{-T}- p J \F^{-T}.
\end{eqnarray}

Using the explicit form of the free-energy $\psi$ discussed in Section~(\ref{freeenergy}) and the definition of the stress tensor~(\ref{TS}), we obtain:
\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
\mu_s = p v_s + \mu_s^0+ kT&\left[\ln \frac{C_s v_s}{1+C_s v_s} + \frac{1}{1+C_sv_s}\right.
\\&\left.\ \ \ \ \ \ +\frac{\chi}{(1+C_s v)^2}-\sum_i \frac{C_i}{C_s}\right], 
\end{aligned}\label{temp8}\\
\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon J} \F^T \F\, \mathbf{H},\label{temp6}\\[2mm]
\mu_i = \mu^0_i + e\Phi z_i + kT \ln \frac{C_i}{ C_s},\\[2mm]
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{T}= -p \mathbb{I} + \frac{G^A_1}{1+C_sv_s}\left(\mathbb{B}-\mathbb{I}\right) &+ \frac{G^A_2}{1+C_sv_s}\left(\mathbb{B}_e-\mathbb{I}\right)\\ &- \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left(\frac{1}{2} \,\mathbf{h}\cdot  \mathbf{h} \mathbb{I} -\mathbf{h} \otimes \mathbf{h}\right).\label{temp7}
\end{aligned}
\end{gather}

Rewriting Equation~(\ref{temp6}) in terms of variables in the current configuration and using the definition of the electrical potential, Equation~(\ref{Phi}), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}=\epsilon \mathbf{e}=-\epsilon \nabla \Phi.
\end{equation}
Substituting the above equation into Gauss law~(\ref{gauss}) and~(\ref{temp7}), we can rewrite the System~(\ref{temp8})-(\ref{temp7}) as:
\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
\mu_s = p v_s + \mu_s^0 + k_BT&\left[\ln \frac{C_s v_s}{1+C_s v_s} + \frac{1}{1+C_sv_s}\right.\\
&\left.\ \ \ \ \ \ +\frac{\chi}{(1+C_s v_s)^2}-\sum_i \frac{C_i}{C_s}\right], 
\end{aligned}\\[2.5mm]
\mu_i = \mu^0_i + e\Phi z_i + kT \ln \frac{C_i}{C_s},\\
-\epsilon J \nabla^2 \Phi = Q\, ,
\end{gather}
\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{T}= -p \mathbb{I}+ \frac{G^A_1}{1+C_sv_s}\left(\mathbb{B}-\mathbb{I}\right) + \frac{G^A_2}{1+C_sv_s}\left(\mathbb{B}_e-\mathbb{I}\right) \\
+\epsilon \left[\frac{1}{2} \,|\nabla \Phi|^2\mathbb{I} -\nabla \Phi \otimes \nabla \Phi\right],
\end{aligned}
\end{gather}
\section{Energy Dissipation.}
\label{apenergy}
In this section, we expose the details of the derivation of the governing equations~(\ref{gov2})-(\ref{Be}) presented in Section~(\ref{ent}).

Combining Equations~(\ref{vflow1}) and (\ref{vflow2}), we can characterise the viscous flow by the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\LL_v = \frac{L_{vv}}{T}\text{DEV}[\mathbb{M}_e]= \frac{L_{vv}}{T}\text{DEV}\left[\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}\right] = \frac{G^A_2}{\eta^A}\text{DEV}\left[\mathbb{C}_e\right] ,\label{Lv1}
\end{equation}
where $\eta^A$ represents the viscosity of the material. If we denote by $\tau_R$ the time-scale of the viscous relaxation this is define as:
\begin{equation}
\tau_R = \frac{\eta^A}{2G^A_2}.\label{tau}
\end{equation}

If we now consider the left elastic Cauchy Green tensor $\mathbb{B}_e=\F_e \F^T_e$, we can relate its time derivative to $\LL_v$ and $\LL=\dot{\F}\F^{-1}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathbb{B}}_e &= \LL \mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - 2 \F_e d_v \F_e^{T} \\
&= \LL\mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - \frac{1}{\tau_R} \F_e\left[\mathbb{C}_e-\frac{1}{3}tr(\mathbb{B}_e)\mathbb{I}\right]\F_e^T\\
&= \LL\mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - \frac{1}{\tau_R} \,\mathbb{B}_e\underbrace{\left[\mathbb{B}_e-\frac{1}{3}tr(\mathbb{B}_e)\mathbb{I}\right]}_{\text{DEV}[\mathbb{B}_e]}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For what concern the dissipation due to transport phenomena, the forces $\zeta_m$ are dependent on the deformation. For this reason, it is more suitable to move from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian coordinates. So that Equation~(\ref{dif}) can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{j}_m = \sum_{k=s,1,\ldots,N} \frac{L_{mk}J^{-1}}{T} \mathbb{B}\nabla \mu_k= \sum_{k=s,1,\ldots,N} \ell_{mk} \nabla \mu_k. \label{dif2}
\end{equation}
where the coefficient $\ell_{mk}$ are now constant, i.e. they are independent of the deformation. These can be correlated to drag coefficients, which are commonly used in the theory of mixtures \cite{ecm1,ecm2}. Let us first rewrite the fluxes as $\mathbf{j}_m = c_m (\mathbf{v}_m-\mathbf{v}_n)= c_m \bar{\mathbf{v}}_{m}$, where $\mathbf{v}_m$ is the velocity of the $m$-th component in the current configuration, $\mathbf{v}_n$ is the velocity of the network also in the current configuration and  $\bar{\mathbf{v}}_{m}$ is the relative velocity of the $m$-th component with respect to the network. If now invert Equations~(\ref{dif2}), we obtain the following linear system:
\begin{eqnarray}
-c_j \nabla \mu_j = \sum_{m} h_{jm} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_m= \sum_{i\neq j} f_{ji} \left(\bar{\mathbf{v}}_j-\bar{\mathbf{v}}_i\right) + f_{js} (\bar{\mathbf{v}}_j-\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s) + f_{jn} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_j,\label{drag1}\\
-c_s \nabla \mu_s = \sum_i f_{si} \left(\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s-\bar{\mathbf{v}}_i\right)+ f_{sn} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_s,
\end{eqnarray}
where $j=1\ldots N$, $f_{mb}$ are the drag coefficients related to the interaction between the phase $m=s,1,\cdots,N$ and the phase $b=n,s,1,\cdots,N$. Based on the Onsanger's reciprocal relation we have that:
\begin{equation}
f_{mb}=f_{bm} \qquad m,b\, \in\, \left\{s,1,\cdots,N\right\}.
\end{equation}
A common assumption in the study of mixture theory is that the solute-solute drag can be neglected so that $f_{ij}=0$ for $i,j=1,\ldots,N$ \cite{bookbiophys,ecm1}. The remaining drag coefficient are instead defined by:
\begin{equation}
f_{sn} = \frac{1}{k}, \ \ f_{js}=\frac{k_BT c_j}{D^0_{j}},\ \  f_{js}+f_{jn}= \frac{k_BT c_j}{D_j}, \label{drag2}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the hydraulic permeability of the solvent in the network, $D^0_j$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in pure solution, while $D_j$ is the diffusion coefficient in the gel.

Using~(\ref{drag1})-(\ref{drag2}), the relative velocities are of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s = -K  \left(\nabla \mu_s +\sum_i \frac{D_i}{D^0_i} \frac{C_i}{C_s} \nabla \mu_i\right),\label{vbar2}\\
\bar{\mathbf{v}}_j = - \frac{D_j}{k_B T}\nabla \mu_j + \frac{D_j}{D^0_j} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_s, \label{vbar}
\end{eqnarray}
and the coefficient $K$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{c_sk} + \sum_i \frac{k_B T}{D^0_i} \left(1-\frac{D_i}{D^0_i}\right) \frac{C_i}{C_s}.
\end{equation}
If we now move back to the initial configuration, we have that the fluxes $\mathbf{J}_m$ have the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{J}_m = J \F^{-1} \mathbf{j}_m= J \F^{-1} c_m \bar{\mathbf{v}}_s,\label{flux}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s$ are defined by Equations~(\ref{vbar2})-(\ref{vbar}). Substituting now Equations~(\ref{flux}) into the conservation of mass laws~(\ref{consmass}), we recover the governing equations~(\ref{gov2})-(\ref{gov3}) in Section~(\ref{ent}).
