\section{Composition of Extracellular Matrix.}
\label{ECMcomp}
Despite the tissue-specific nature of Extracellular Matrix (ECM), this is usually composed of a network of collagen fibrils entangled with proteoglycans (PGAs) which are covalently bonded to charged chains of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), see Figure \ref{ECMfig_a}.  While collagen is mainly responsible for the mechanical behaviour of the tissue, GAGs can imbibe water, giving the extracellular matrix the ability to swell while maintaining its structural integrity. As mentioned in the introduction, from this point of view, the ECM is a polyelectrolyte gel. As schematically illustrated in Figure \ref{ECMfig}(b), polyelectrolyte gels are 3D networks of cross-linked polymer chains that contain ionizable functional groups. When in solution the gel swells, while the functional groups dissociate into fixed charges and mobile ions in the solution.  In particular, research has been focusing on the phenomena of swelling, i.e. large deformation due to absorption of water, and the diffusion transport and release of solution  \cite{DROZDOV+,DROZDOVph,Reviewpolyel,swell2}. However, only a small fraction of the study published accounts for the visco-elastic properties of the polymer network.

	\label{ECMfig}
\end{figure}

For the purpose of this study, we will not explicitly distinguish between collagen, PGAs and GAGs. At the tissue level, this can be grouped into a single solid phase (the polymer network), whose mechanical properties are treated as the average over the different components contribution. The interstitial fluid is instead treated as a two-phase solution: the solvent (i.e. water) and the solutes (free ions). The transport of the solution also contributes to the dissipation of energy due to the friction forces generated by the relative motion of the different phases.

As is common in multiphase models of tissue, we will assume that the matrix is isotropic and GAGs are evenly distributed on the network. While this is not a good approximation for tissue like cartilage, which are highly anisotropic, it does apply to the extracellular matrix found in soft tissue such as liver, brain and tumours. It is also important to point out that ECM has additional properties such as thermo-sensitivity and pH-sensitivity. However, both in living organisms and in experimental set-up temperature and pH are maintained fairly constant.

\section{Non Equilibrium Thermodynamics.}
\label{secNET}
As mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in studying the deformation of the ECM and the transport of solution in it. Since these are irreversible processes, they can not be described in the framework of equilibrium thermodynamics. 

In the case of irreversible processes, the change in the entropy of a system $\d S$ results from both the reversible exchange of energy and matter with the external environment $\d_eS$ and the internal dissipation of energy during the process $\d_iS$ \cite{NET}:
\begin{equation}
\d S = \d_eS + \d_iS, 
\end{equation}
According to the second law of thermodynamics, which applies universally to any system or any of its sub-part $\d_i S\ge 0$. It is important to notice that the second law allows transformations in which total change in entropy $d S$ of the system is negative. This occurs whenever $-\d_e S>\d_i S$ and it can lead to the spontaneous formation of complex and ordered structures such as living organisms. From this point of view, life emerges in physics as an efficient mechanism able to increase sufficiently the entropy of its environment \cite{JeremyEngland}.  

In this study, we will focus on isothermal processes, i.e. $T=const$, as this well approximate physiological conditions. Under this assumption, as derived by Gurtin in \cite{GURTIN}, the second law of thermodynamics is equivalent to the following \textit{energy imbalance inequality}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\d}{\d t} \left\{\int_R \psi \right\}\leq W(R) + M(R) \label{energyin}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is a arbitrary control volume of the system, $\psi$ is the Helmholtz free energy, $W(R)$ is the rate at which the environment does work on $R$ and $M(R)$ is the inflow of mass due to transport. It is important to note that, as long as the quantities involved are well defined, the energy inequality~(\ref{energyin}) holds for any isothermal process independently of the specific physical system considered. This imposes a constraint on the form of the function $\psi$ and its dependence on the other thermodynamic variables, such as temperature or pressure, which are used to describe the system. 

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics mainly focuses on defining the form of $\d_i S$, which, unlike the reversible entropy production $\d_e S$, is not a state variable but depends on the specific transformation applied to the system. 
Different theories have been proposed, \cite{NET}, each with its assumptions and specific domain of applicability. In our study we will focus on \textquotedblleft Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics'' (CIT) which was pioneered by Onsager \cite{onsager} and Prigogine \cite{prigogine} in the first half of the 20th century. One the most important assumptions of this theory is the \textit{Local Equilibrium Hypothesis}, which guarantees thermodynamic variables, including entropy, are locally well-defined, \cite{NET}. 
Consequently, we can introduce the entropy density $s=s(\mathbf{x},t)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
S = \int_{R} s \,\d V, \qquad \d s = \d_e s + \d_is, \qquad \d_is > 0, 
\end{equation}
and the local entropy production:
\begin{equation}
\sigma \equiv \frac{\d_i s}{\d t} \geq 0.
\end{equation}

Another central aspect of the theory is the introduction of \textit{thermodynamic forces} \footnote{Not to be intended in the mechanical sense} $F_m$ (causes) and \textit{thermodynamic fluxes} $J_m$ (effects) to describe the time evolution of the system during an irreversible transformation. These are related to $\sigma$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sum_m F_m J_m\geq 0.
\label{2law}
\end{equation}

While the local equilibrium hypothesis is at the basis of most theories of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the following two hypotheses uniquely identify CIT:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] \textit{Linear Relation between forces $F$ and fluxes $J$}:
	\begin{equation}
	J_m = \sum_k L_{mk} F_k,\label{lin}
	\end{equation}
	where the constant $L_{mk}$ are referred to as \textbf{phenomenological coefficients};
	\item[2.] \textit{Microscopic Reversibility}: time reversibility of processes at the micro-scale. 
\end{itemize}

Starting from these two principles, in his seminal paper \cite{onsager} Onsager derives the well-known \textit{Onsager Reciprocal Relation}:
\begin{equation}
L_{mk}=L_{km}.
\end{equation}

If we now consider an isothermal transformation in the framework of CIT, alongside with the energy imbalance inequality, we have that the following must hold:

\begin{equation}
W(R)+M(R)-\frac{\d}{\d t} \left\{\int_R \psi \right\} = T \int_R \sigma \,\d V\, ,
\label{eqCIT}
\end{equation}

In the past few decades, CIT has been applied successfully to the modelling of several physical phenomena of interest for engineers, physicists and applied mathematicians. However, its validity is limited to phenomena near-equilibrium, for which a linear approximation of the flux-force relation holds. The growing interest in more complex far-from-equilibrium phenomena has pushed toward the development of a more general framework for the study of a non-equilibrium phenomena. Since this goes beyond the purpose of our study, we will not discuss it further. We do, however, highlight the law of steepest entropy ascent, which, according to Beretta \cite{SEA2}, seems to emerge as the fourth fundamental law of nature. In the linear regime, this principle can be used to prove Onsager's reciprocal relation \cite{SEA1}, with no reference to the microscopic reversibility hypothesis, whose validity remains instead controversial \cite{CIT}.

\section{Model Development}
\label{modeldev}
\subsection{Conservation Law.}
\label{conslaw}
As mentioned in Section \ref{ECMcomp}, we here consider the ECM as a three-phase medium composed of a solid polymer network with fixed charges, a solvent (i.e. water molecules, interstitial fluid) and solutes (freely moving charges). 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{0.9\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/deformation.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Sketch of the dry and current state of the ECM network.}
	\label{Above}
\end{figure}

As the tissue deforms, the material element originally located at $\mathbf{X}$ in the initial configuration $\mathcal{B}_0$ is displaced to the point $\mathbf{x}$ in the current configuration $\mathcal{B}_t$, see Figure \ref{Above}. Such transformation is described by the deformation gradient tensor $\F= \partial \mathbf{x}/\partial \mathbf{X}$; the information about the change in ECM volume is encoded in $J= \det \F$. As in \cite{sarah}, we consider the reference, or initial, state $\mathcal{B}_0$, which is stress free, to be equivalent to the dry stage of the ECM, i.e. only solid phase present. Since we assume the solid phase to be incompressible, any change in the volume can only be related to the migration of solvent and solutes molecules, whose nominal \footnote{variable value in the reference configuration.} concentrations will be denoted by $C_s$ and $C_i$ respectively, $i=1,\ldots,N$ with $N$ being the number of free ion species. This lead to the molecular incompressibility condition:

\begin{equation}
 J= 1 + v_s C_s +\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} v_i C_i
 \label{comp}
\end{equation}
where $v_m$ are the characteristic molecular volume of each species in the solution. When considering the interstitial fluid, the contribution of ions to the volume can be neglected \cite{ecm1,ecm2} so that Equation~(\ref{comp}) reduces to:

\begin{equation}
J=1+v_s C_s.
\label{inc}
\end{equation} 

Consequently, the volume fractions of fluid $\phi_f$ and solid $\phi_n$ phases in the swollen ECM are defined as:
\begin{equation}
\phi_f = \frac{v_sC_s}{1+v_sC_s}, \qquad \phi_n = \frac{1}{1+v_sC_s}.
\end{equation}
where again we are neglecting the contribution of ions to the total volume.
While $C_m$ denote the number of each molecule per unit volume in the initial configuration for the $m$-th species in the solution, the actual concentration in the current state is denoted by $c_m=C_m/J$. Throughout the derivation of the model, we will be using the index $i=1,\ldots,N$ to denote the ionic species only, while $m\in\left\{s,1,\ldots,N\right\}$ refers to all mobile species, i.e. both the solvent and solutes.

Mass conservation must apply to all mobile species and in the initial configuration this reads:
\begin{equation}
\dot{C}_m + \nabla_0 \cdot \mathbf{J}_m = 0, \label{consmass}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{J}_m$ is the nominal flux per unit area in the dry state, $\dot{C}_m$ is the derivative of $C_m$ with respect to time, i.e.  $\dot{C}_m\equiv\partial_t C_m$ and $\nabla_0$ denote the gradient in the Lagrangian coordinates $\mathbf{X}$. Their counterparts in the actual configuration are denoted by $\mathbf{j}_m$ and $\nabla$ and are defined according to the following rules:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{J}_m = J \F^{-1} \mathbf{j}_m, \qquad \nabla_0 (\cdot) = \F^{T} \nabla(\cdot).
\end{equation}

When considering tissues or hydrogels, inertial and gravitational effect are commonly neglected, so that the conservation of momentum for the ECM reads:

\begin{gather}
\nabla_0 \cdot \mathbb{S}=0\label{consmom},
\end{gather}

where $\mathbb{S}$ is the first Piola-Kirchoff tensor, which represents the stress state of the ECM in the initial configuration. The counterpart in the current configuration is the Cauchy stress tensor $\mathbb{T}$, which is related to $\mathbb{S}$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{T} = J^{-1}\mathbb{S}\F^T.
\end{equation}

The presence of free moving ions generates an electric field which is denoted by $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{e}$ in the initial and current configuration respectively. Introducing the electrostatic potential $\Phi$, we have that:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}= -\nabla_0 \, \Phi, \hspace{8mm} \mathbf{e}= - \nabla \, \Phi.
\end{equation}

As in \cite{Reviewpolyel}, we consider the matrix to be a dielectric material\footnote{a material that does not conduct electricity but can be polarized in the presence of an electric field.}. Consequently, the presence of the electric field generates an electric displacement $\mathbf{H}$\footnote{the vector field that accounts for both the electric field and the polarization of the dielectric material.}, which must obey Gauss law of electrostatics:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_0 \cdot \mathbf{H}= Q,
\label{gauss}
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the local total charge, which accounts for both fixed and moving charges:
\begin{equation}
Q = e\left(\sum\limits_{i} z_i C_i+z_f C_{f}\right)\, , 
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $C_f$ is the concentration of fix charges and $z_m$ is the valence of the corresponding charged species. Note that $C_f$ here corresponds to the concentration of GAGs, which is assumed to be a constant a fraction of $C_s$. As for above, we can move from nominal quantities to the corresponding value in the current configuration by applying the following rules:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{H} = J \mathbf{h}\F^{-T},\\
\mathbf{E} = \F^T \mathbf{e},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{h}$ is the electric displacement in the current configuration.

\subsection{Kinematics.}
\label{kin}

As mentioned in the introduction, we model the ECM as a poro-visco-elastic material, with particular interest in the viscous aspect of the material. As shown in Figure \ref{deformation}, there are two molecular processes that give rise to the macroscopic time-dependent response of the system: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item [1.] the rearrangements of molecules at the micro-scale,  which has entropic origin and result in a volume-preserving viscous deformation;
	\item[2.] the long range transport of fluid that leads to swelling, i.e. changes in the ECM's size, and give rise to frictional forces between phases. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\hspace{-12mm}
	\def\svgwidth{1.2\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/visco_poro.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Illustration of the molecular processes which account for the macroscopic deformation of ECM: viscosity is related to change in the conformation of the network which preserve the volume of the network.}
	\label{deformation}
\end{figure}
As illustrated in Figure \ref{deformation}, at the microscopic level this results in a visco-elastic and poro-elastic behaviour respectively.

In order to capture both phenomena, as common in the large-deformation theory \cite{Article1,CACCAVO2,Plasto,magneto,NGUYEN,growthtum} and first proposed by Kr\"{o}ner in 1960 \cite{kro}, we consider a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation tensor $\F$. As this can be choose arbitrary, different decomposition have been proposed in the literature. We will here consider the two most commonly used, which will be here denoted as model A \cite{Article1,CACCAVO2,Plasto} and model B \cite{magneto,NGUYEN,Jeru}:

\begin{gather}
\text{MODEL A} \Rightarrow\begin{cases}
\F=\F_e\F_v,\\
\det\F_v=1, \quad \det\F_e=\det\F
\end{cases} \label{dec1}\tag{A}\\[4pt]
\text{MODEL B} \Rightarrow\begin{cases}
\F= \F_{vol}\bar{\F}=\F_{vol}\bar{\F}_e\bar{\F}_v\\
\det\F=\det\F_{vol},\quad \det\bar{\F}=\det\bar{\F}_e=\det\bar{\F}_v=1.\label{dec2}
\end{cases}\tag{B}
\end{gather}

Comparing the two, we note that the only difference is that in model B the volumetric deformation, $\F_{vol}$, is decoupled from the deviatoric one, $\bar{\F}$.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous systematic study in the literature that compares these two approaches. While the two model are identical in the case of iso-volumetric deformation, i.e. $\det \F=J=1$, this is not always the case when a tissue swells. As it will be clear in Section \ref{excomp}, the choice of how to decompose the vector $\F$ can not be arbitrary but should instead be treated as a constitutive assumption on the material properties. This highlights the need of experimental testing to validate which model better describe the material studied.

As an explanatory example on how mathematical models can be derived in the non-equilibrium thermodynamics framework, we will fully here derive the governing equation for model A. The interested reader can find the details of the derivation for model B in Appendix \ref{modelB}.

\label{Model2}
\end{figure}

Looking back at System~(\ref{dec1}), we identify $\F_e$ as the elastic contribution to the deformation while, the term $\F_v$ accounts for the viscous flow. As illustrate in Figure \ref{Model2}, the multiplicative decomposition is equivalent to introducing an intermediate configuration $\mathcal{B}_v$, called the natural or virtual configuration. The evolution of the natural configuration can be interpreted as an entropy producing, i.e. dissipative, process. On the other hand, in the elastic deformation from the natural to the current configuration all the energy is stored in the system. 

Using Equation~(\ref{dec1}), we can compute the velocity gradient tensor $\LL$:
\begin{equation}
\LL = \dot{\F}\F^{-1} = \LL_e + \F_e \LL_v \F_e^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $\LL_e=\dot{\F}_e\F_e^{-1}$ and $\LL_v=\dot{\F}_v\F_v^{-1}$ are respectively the elastic and viscous velocity gradient tensor. These can be decomposed in their symmetric $\mathbb{D}$ and skewed $\mathbb{W}$ part:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\LL_e = \mathbb{D}_e + \mathbb{W}_e, \ \ \mathbb{D}_e = \frac{\LL_e+\LL^T_e}{2}, \ \ \mathbb{W}_e = \frac{\LL_e-\LL^T_e}{2};\\
\LL_v = \mathbb{D}_v + \mathbb{W}_v,  \ \ \mathbb{D}_v = \frac{\LL_v+\LL^T_v}{2}, \ \ \mathbb{W}_v = \frac{\LL_v-\LL^T_v}{2}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The decomposition~(\ref{dec1}) is not unique, as stress state in $\mathcal{B}_v$ would not change under any arbitrary rigid-body rotation \cite{multdec}. As suggested by \cite{Plasto}, in the case of isotropic material, it is reasonable to assume the viscous flow to be irrotational, i.e. $\mathbb{W}_v=\mathbb{O}$, so that $\LL_v \equiv \mathbb{D}_v$.
As mentioned before, the physical nature of the viscous deformation is molecular rearrangement so that volume is preserved. This requires to introduce the additional constraint:
\begin{equation}
J_v=\det \F_v= 1.\label{Jv}
\end{equation}

\input{derivation2}

\subsection{Evolution Equation.}

In order to get a better physical insight into the behaviour, we first rewrite the solvent chemical potential as:
\begin{gather}
\mu_s = \mu^0_s + k_B T \left(\frac{p v_s}{k_BT} +\Pi_{osm}-\sum_i \frac{C_i}{C_s} -\frac{\gamma J}{k_B T}\Pi_{grad}\right)\label{mu2},\\
\Pi_{osm}=\ln \frac{C_s v_s}{1+C_s v_s} + \frac{1}{1+C_sv_s}+\frac{\chi}{(1+C_s v_s)^2},\\
\Pi_{grad} = \nabla^2 C_s,
\end{gather}
where $p$ represents the pore pressure, $\Pi_{osm}$ is the osmotic pressure of the solution and $\Pi_{grad}$ is the pressure due to interface energy. If we now substitute into Equations~(\ref{gov2}) the chemical potentials~(\ref{mu2})-(\ref{mu}), which yields to:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\partial_t C_s=\nabla_0 \cdot\left\{K\F^{-1}\left[C_s v_s\nabla p - \color{red}\gamma C_s J\nabla \Pi_{grad}\color{black}+\sum_i \frac{D_i}{D^0_i} C_i e z_i \nabla \Phi\right.\right.\\
\left.\left.+ k_B T\color{teal} \left(C_s \nabla \Pi_{osm}+ \sum_i\left(1-\frac{D_iC_i}{D^0_iC_s}\right) \nabla C_s - \sum_i\left(1-\frac{D_i}{D^0_i}\right) \nabla C_i \right)\color{black}\right]\right\}.\label{long}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The above equation shows that the solvent transport is driven by pressure gradient, osmotic pressure gradient (green term in Equation~(\ref{long})), electric potential gradient and the additional composition gradient (red term in Equation~(\ref{long})), which is here first introduced in the context of polyelectrolytes. In the absence of solutes ($C_i\equiv 0$), we recover the same model presented by Hennessy et. al~\cite{sarah}. If we further assume that $|\nabla \Pi_{grad}|<<1$ and take the limit $v_sC_S\rightarrow\infty$, Equations~(\ref{long}) reduces to Darcy's law for the flow in a porous media. The model for polyelectrolytes proposed by Hong \cite{Reviewpolyel} correspond instead to the limit $D^0_i\rightarrow\infty$, i.e. mobile species can move freely in pure solution, and  $|\nabla \Pi_{grad}|<<1$.

Similarly we can rewrite Equation~(\ref{gov3}) as:
\begin{equation}
\scriptsize
\partial_t C_i = \nabla_0 \left[D_i\F^{-1}\left(\underbrace{\nabla C_i}_{\text{diffusion}} +\underbrace{\frac{eC_iz_i}{k_B T} \nabla \Phi}_{\text{electric}}\right)-\underbrace{\frac{D_i C_i}{C_s}\F^{-1}\nabla C_s}_{\text{osmotic pressure}}-\underbrace{\frac{D_i C_i}{D^0_iC_s}\mathbf{J}_s}_{\text{advenction}}\right]\label{long2}
\end{equation}

In the case of ions, the driving forces of transport are the diffusion of ions, the electric field, the osmotic pressure due to the mixing with the solvent and the advection term (due to the relative movement of ions with respect to the solvent). In the limit $D^0_i\rightarrow0$, where the ions can freely move in the pure solution, we recover the formulation of Hong in \cite{Reviewpolyel}, which is commonly used in the description of polyelectrolytes. In the dilute limit, i.e. when the concentration of ions is much smaller than the solvent  concentration $C_i<<C_s$, we can drop both the osmotic and advection term so to recover the well-known Nernst-Planck equation \cite[see Equation (6.67)]{Reviewpolyel}.

As mentioned in the introduction, one the major aspect of interest is the visco-elastic contribution to the evolution of the system. Even though in the transport Equation~(\ref{long})-(\ref{long2}) there is no direct reference to it, the transport is indirectly coupled to the visco-relaxation through the pressure gradient. Taking the divergence of Equation~(\ref{sys3}) and using the conservation of momentum~(\ref{consmom}), we can identify components to the pressure gradient:

\begin{equation}
\nabla p= \nabla \cdot \mathbb{T}^{kort} + \nabla \cdot \mathbb{T}^{Max} + G_1^A\underbrace{ \nabla \cdot \left[\frac{\B-\mathbb{I}}{1+v_sC_s}\right]}_{\substack{\text{swelling}\\\text{+ deviatoric}\\\text{ deformation}}} + \,\color{red} G_2^A \underbrace{\nabla \cdot\left[\frac{\B_e-\mathbb{I}}{1+v_sC_s}\right]}_{\color{black}\substack{\text{swelling}\\\text{+ deviatoric}\\\text{deformation}\\\text{+ viscous relaxation}}}\color{black}
\end{equation}

Differently from the standard Neo-Hookean model for polyelectrolytes, we have an additional term highlighted in red, which accounts for the energy stored in the second spring of model A. Its time evolution, as determined by Equation~(\ref{Be}) is driven by the swelling and macroscopic deformation and a relaxation term which capture the viscous nature of the solid phase:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbb{B}}_e=\underbrace{\LL\mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T}_{\substack{\text{swelling}\\\text{+ deviatoric}\\\text{deformation}}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{\tau_R} \,\mathbb{B}_e\text{DEV}[\mathbb{B}_e]}_{\substack{\text{viscous}\\\text{relaxation}}}\label{Be2}
\end{equation}


Despite the introduction of the non-linear terms, there is an apparent analogy between the above Equation and the ODE describing the standard linear solid, see Equation~(SLS) in the Introduction. The term $\dot{\epsilon} \leftrightarrow \LL$ is related to the strain experienced by spring 1, while $\epsilon_e  \leftrightarrow \mathbb{B}_e$ is the variable describing the strain on the 2. In the limit $\tau_R\rightarrow \infty$, we have that $\mathbb{B}_e\equiv\mathbb{B}$. We thus recover the standard Neo-Hookean hyper-elastic model for hydrogels with shear modulus given by $G^A_1+G^A_2$. Similar result are obtained for model B. The governing equation of Model B is equivalent to~(\ref{Be2}), except for the fact that it is not influence by purely volumetric deformation:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\bar{\mathbb{B}}}_e=\underbrace{\bar{\LL}\bar{\mathbb{B}}_e + \bar{\mathbb{B}}_e \bar{\LL}^T}_{\substack{\text{deviatoric}\\\text{deformation}}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{\tau_R} \,\bar{\mathbb{B}}_e\text{DEV}[\bar{\mathbb{B}}_e]}_{\substack{\text{viscous}\\\text{relaxation}}}
\end{equation}
while the pressure gradient is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\nabla p= \nabla \cdot \mathbb{T}^{kort} + \nabla \cdot \mathbb{T}^{Max} + G_1^B\underbrace{ \nabla \cdot \left[\frac{\text{DEV}[\bar{\mathbb{B}}]}{1+v_sC_s}\right]}_{\substack{\text{+ deviatoric}\\\text{ deformation}}} \\
+ \,\color{red} G_2^B \underbrace{\nabla \cdot\left[\frac{\text{DEV}[\bar{\mathbb{B}}_e]}{1+v_sC_s}\right]}_{\color{black}\substack{\text{ deviatoric}\\\text{deformation}\\\text{+ viscous relaxation}}}\color{black}+ G_{vol}\underbrace{\nabla \left(\frac{J^{2/3}-1}{J}\right)}_{swelling}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

As we will discuss in the next section, when considering instead a purely volumetric deformation, such as for free swelling, i.e. $\F=\F_{vol}=J^{1/3}\mathbb{I}$, we have that the two model are equivalent given that $G_{vol}\equiv G_A +G_B$. Before comparing the model in different experimental setting, we have briefly summarised in Table~(\ref{summary}) the variables and governing equation for both models. In order to have a close solution, the proper boundary and initial conditions needs also to be assigned depending on the specific problem considered.

\section{Elasticity: Equilibrium Behaviour.}
In this section, we will be focusing on the equilibrium behaviour of the two model under free and compressed swelling. Given the large number of parameter in the models, such experiment allows to estimate a subset of them. While previous model proposed in the literature have been arbitrarily chosen how to decompose the deformation gradient $\F$, we here shows that such choice need to consider equal to a constitutive equation and thus tested experimentally. 

\subsection{Unconstrained Free Swelling.} 
\label{free}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{0.95\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/freeswell.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Schematic representation of a free swelling. Since we are considering an isotropic mixture, the ECM maintains its shape while all dimension are stretched of the same amount $\lambda$. So that the relative volume change is $\delta V = \lambda^3-1$. }
\end{figure}

Having derived the set of equations for both model A and model B, we now want to compare how the two behave in different settings. We first look at unconstrained free swelling of a cuboid slice of ECM immersed in a bath of interstitial fluid. For simplicity we consider that contains only two species of free ions, which carry a positive $C_+$ and a negative $C_-$ charge respectively. We assume the bath to be well-mixed and stress-free with both pressure and electric potential identically zero. We denote by $2c_0$ the total concentration of free ions in the bath, so that $c_0$ is the concentration of each ionic species. As the system evolves, the ECM increases in size until it reaches a steady state which is characterised by the continuity of chemical potentials and stresses across the boundary:
\begin{equation}
\left[\mu_s\right]^+_-=\left[\mu_+\right]^+_-=\left[\mu_-\right]^+_-=0, \quad \left[\mathbf{n} \mathbb{T}\mathbf{n}\right]^+_-=0.
\end{equation}

As in \cite{DROZDOVph}, we consider that at equilibrium the following conditions also holds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] chemical potentials of solvent and solutes is homogeneous and equal in the bath and in the bath:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\mu_s=\mu^{ext}_s = \mu^0_s - vkT \sum_i c^i_0 ,\\\label{free1}
	\mu_i=\mu^{ext}_i = \mu^0_i +kT\ln(v_sc^i_0).
	\end{eqnarray} 
	\item[2.] The electrostatic potential and the solute concentration are constant in the ECM, but different to the value in the bath. This difference creates a thin charged interface at the boundary, whose thickness is negligible compared to the size of the ECM.
	\item[3.] The contribution of $\mathbb{T}^{Max}$ and $\mathbb{T}^{kort}$to the stress at this interface can be neglected compared to the mechanical stress due to the deformation. 
	\item[4.] The Cauchy stress tensor is constant in the ECM and equal to the value in the bath:
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{T}=0.\label{free2}
	\end{equation} 
\end{itemize}

Finally, in order to characterise the equilibrium, we need to specify the deformation gradient tensor, which is of the form:
\begin{equation}
\F= \lambda \mathbb{I},\label{deffree}                                                                
\end{equation}
with $\lambda=(1+C_s v_s)^{1/3}$. 
Throughout the work, unless differently specified, we will use the parameters listed in Table \ref{Tab1} in Appendix~(\ref{para}).

As shown in Appendix \ref{apfree}, imposing the equilibrium condition to both model A and B, we obtain that the nominal concentration of oxygen in the gel at equilibrium is implicitly defined by the algebraic equation:

\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
F_{A}(C_s; c_0,\chi,G^A_{eq})=&\frac{1+C_sv_s+\chi}{(1+C_sv_s)^2}+\frac{p v_s}{k_BT}+\ln \frac{C_sv_s}{1+C_sv_s} +2c_0v_s\\[1.5mm]
&-\sqrt{\left(\frac{z_fC_f}{C_s}\right)^2+4v_s^2c^2_0} =0 \label{eqF}
\end{aligned}
\end{gather}
where the pressure $p$ is defined according to the model used as:
\begin{equation}
p = \begin{cases}
\frac{G^A_{eq}}{1+C_sv_s}(\lambda^2-1)\qquad \text{MODEL A}\\
\frac{G^B_{vol}}{1+C_sv_s}(\lambda^2-1)\qquad \text{MODEL B}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $G^A_eq=G^A_1+G^A_2$. In this case, both model reduces to the standard hyper-elastic model for polyelectrolytes proposed by Hong \cite{Reviewpolyel}. The most important characteristic of the model are summarised in Figure \ref{analysis}, which highlights the effect of different ion concentration in the bath on the degree of swelling. The behaviour is also sensitive to the value of the mixing parameter $\chi$, which can be manipulated controlling the temperature. Depending on the latter, the ECM will either be in a highly swollen or collapsed phased with really low absorption of fluid \cite{Salt}.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Free Swelling: (a) Manifold implicitly defined by Equation~(\ref{eqF}) where $G^A_{eq}=10^3$ is fixed, while $c_0$ and $\chi$ are varied. On the vertical axis, we have plot $\lambda$ as defined by~(\ref{deffree}). In the red, it is highlighted the plane corresponding to $\chi=\chi_{crit}$ that split the parameter space into the region of high swelling and collapse for the material \cite{}.}
	\label{analysis}
\end{figure}

As the model are equivalent, we conclude that common unconstrained swelling experiments that test the equilibrium state are not sufficient to discern between the two, but can be useful to estimate some of the several parameter in the model.

\section{Energy Dissipation.}
\label{apenergy}
Combining Equation~(\ref{vflow1}) and (\ref{vflow2}), and imposing that condition~(\ref{Jv}) is satisfied, we can characterise the viscous flow by the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\LL_v = L_{vv}T^{-1}\left[\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}-p_v\mathbb{I}\right] \stackrel{(\ast)}{=} \frac{G^A_2}{\eta^A}\text{DEV}\left[\mathbb{C}_e\right] ,\label{Lv1}
\end{equation}
where $\eta^A$ represent the viscosity of the material and the equality $(\ast)$ follows from Equation~(\ref{temp4}):
\begin{equation}
\eta^A tr(\LL_v)= tr\left(\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}\right) -  3 p_v=0 \Longrightarrow  p_v = \frac{tr\left(\F_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \F_e}\right)}{3}.
\end{equation}
Using Equation~(\ref{hyp}), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\LL_v = \frac{G^A_2 }{\eta^A}\text{DEV}[\mathbb{C}_e] = \frac{\text{DEV}[\mathbb{C}_e]}{2\tau_R}.\label{apBe}
\end{equation}

If we now consider the left elastic Cauchy Green tensor $\mathbb{B}_e=\F_e \F^T_e$, we can relate its time derivative to $\LL_v$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathbb{B}}_e &= \LL \mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - 2 \F_e d_v \F_e^{T} \\
&= \LL\mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - \frac{1}{\tau_R} \F_e\left[\mathbb{C}_e-\frac{1}{3}tr(\mathbb{B}_e)\mathbb{I}\right]\F_e^T\\
&= \LL\mathbb{B}_e + \mathbb{B}_e \LL^T - \frac{1}{\tau_R} \,\mathbb{B}_e\underbrace{\left[\mathbb{B}_e-\frac{1}{3}tr(\mathbb{B}_e)\mathbb{I}\right]}_{\text{DEV}[\mathbb{B}_e]}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For what concern the dissipation due to transport phenomena, the forces $\varsigma_m$ is dependent on the deformation. For this reason, it is more suitable to move from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian coordinates.  Using the  can rewrite the flux as $\mathbf{j}_m = c_m (\mathbf{v}_m-\mathbf{v}_n)= c_m \bar{\mathbf{v}}_{m}$, where $\mathbf{v}_m$ is the velocity of the $m$-th component in the current configuration, $\mathbf{v}_n$ is the velocity of the network also in the current configuration and  $\bar{\mathbf{v}}_{m}$ is the relative velocity of the $m$-th component with respect to the network. 

In the framework of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the transport dissipation function is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
-c_j \nabla \mu_j = \sum_b L_{jb} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_j= \sum_{i\neq j} f_{ji} \left(\bar{\mathbf{v}}_i-\bar{\mathbf{v}}_j\right) + f_{js} (\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s-\bar{\mathbf{v}}_j) + f_{jn} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_j,\label{drag1}\\
-c_s \nabla \mu_s = \sum_i f_{si} \left(\bar{\mathbf{v}}_i-\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s\right)+ f_{sn} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_s,
\end{eqnarray}
where $f_{mi}$ and $h_{mn}$ are the drag coefficients related to the interaction between fluid constituents and the polymer network respectively. Based on the Onsanger's reciprocal relation we have that:
\begin{equation}
f_{mb}=f_{bm}.
\end{equation}
Common assumption in the study of mixture theory is that the solute-solute drag can be neglected so that $f_{ij}=0$ for $i,j=1,\ldots,N$ \cite{ecm1,biophysics}. The remaining drag coefficient are instead defined by:
\begin{equation}
f_{sn} = \frac{1}{k}, \ \ f_{js}=\frac{k_BT c_j}{D^0_{j}},\ \  f_{js}+f_{jn}= \frac{k_BT c_j}{D_j}, \label{drag2}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the hydraulic permeability of the solvent in the network, $D^0_j$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in pure solution, while $D_j$ is the diffusion coefficient in the gel.

Using~(\ref{drag1})-(\ref{drag2}), the relative velocities are of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{\mathbf{v}}_s = -K J \left(\nabla \mu_s +\sum_i \frac{D_i}{D^0_i} \frac{C_i}{C_s} \nabla \mu_i\right),\\
\bar{\mathbf{v}}_j = - \frac{D_j}{k_B T}\nabla \mu_j + \frac{D_j}{D^0_j} \bar{\mathbf{v}}_s, \label{vbar}
\end{eqnarray}
and the coefficient $K$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{K} = \frac{J}{c_sk} + \sum_i \frac{k_B T}{\phi_w} \left(1-\frac{D_i}{D^0_i}\right) \frac{C_i}{D^0_i}.
\end{equation}

\section{Model B: Separating the Volumetric Deformation.}
\label{modelB}
The derivation of the governing equation for the second model proposed follow the same steps as model A, with few changes. From the point of view of conservation laws (Section \ref{conslaw}), these are still valid as they do not depend on the specific kinetics model chosen. As discussed in Section \ref{kin}, we use multiplicative decomposition to isolate the different contribution to the strain:
\begin{equation}
\F= \bar{\F} \F_{vol}= J^{1/3} \bar{\F}_e \bar{\F}_v,\label{mol2}
\end{equation}
where we have used the fact that $\F_{vol}=J^{1/3}\mathbb{I}$, with $J=\det \F$. Where both $\bar{\F}_e$  and $\bar{\F}_v$ needs to preserve the ECM volume. Analogously to Equation~(\ref{Jv}), this can be ensured by imposing the following condition:
\begin{equation}
\det \bar{\F}_v = 1.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
	\Large
	\def\svgwidth{1\linewidth}
	\input{latex/images/modelB2.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Multiplicative decomposition of Model B}
\end{figure}

In this case it is easier to express the kinematics of the ECM in terms $\LL=\dot{\F}\F^{-1}$, instead of $\dot{\F}$ and $\bar{\LL}_v=\dot{\bar{\F}}_v\bar{\F}_v^{-1}$. When we look at the free energy, we now have three decouple mechanical variables that can contribute to it $J$ for the first spring, $\bar{\F}$ and $\bar{\F}_e$ on due to the springs in branch $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ respectively. Consequently, Equation~(\ref{temp1}) will now be of the form:
\begin{equation}
\psi = \psi (J,\bar{\F}_e, \bar{\F}, C_s, C_i, \nabla_0 \,C_s,\mathbf{H}).\label{aptemp1}
\end{equation}

If we differentiate $J$, $\bar{\F}$ and $\bar{\F}_e$, we can reduce the number of variables expressing them in terms of $\LL$ and $\bar{\LL}_v$:

\begin{gather}
\dot{J} = J (\mathbb{I}:\LL),\\
\dot{\bar{\F}} = J^{-1/3} \LL \F - \frac{1}{3} J^{-1/3} (\mathbb{I}:\LL) \F \\
\dot{\bar{\F}}_e = \text{DEV}[\LL] \bar{\F}_e -\bar{\F}_e \bar{\LL}_v.\label{aptemp2}
\end{gather}
If we now combine Equations~(\ref{aptemp1})-(\ref{aptemp2}) with the energy inequality, what we obtain is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \nabla_0 C_s}-\boldsymbol{\xi}\right) \cdot \nabla_0 \dot{C}_s + \left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial C_s}-\mu_s-\nabla_0 \cdot \boldsymbol{\xi}+p v\right)\dot{C}_s\\
+ \sum_i\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial C_i} + e\Phi z_i-\mu_i\right) \dot{C}_i +\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mathbf{H}}-\mathbf{E}\right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{H}}\\
 +\left(\text{DEV}\left[J^{-1/3}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \bar{\F}}\F^T + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \bar{\F}_e}\bar{\F}_e^{T}\right]- \mathbb{S}\F^T +J\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial J} - p\right)\mathbb{I}\right):\LL\\
 + \sum_m \nabla_0 \,\mu_m \cdot \mathbf{J}_m - \bar{\F}_e^T\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \bar{\F}_e}:\mathbb{\bar{L}}_v\leq 0 . \label{ineq2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Finally we need to update the constitutive laws for the strain free energy $\psi_6$, which, similarly to the case discussed in Section , can be decompose as the sum of contributions from each spring in Figure \ref{figmode}(b):

\begin{equation}
\psi_6 = \psi_1(\bar{\F}) + \psi_2(\bar{\F}_e) + \psi_{vol}(J).
\end{equation}

Again we assume the ECM to behave as an hyperplastic material:
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi_1(\bar{\F}) = \frac{G^B_1}{2} \left(\bar{\F}:\bar{\F} - 3\right),\\
\psi_2(\bar{\F}_e) = \frac{G^B_2}{2} \left(\bar{\F}_e:\bar{\F}_e - 3 \right).
\end{eqnarray}

For the volumetric contribution we consider as before a logarithmic term:
\begin{equation}
\psi_{vol}(J) = \frac{\kappa}{2} \ln J^2. \label{psivol}
\end{equation}
ALTERNATIVE:
\begin{equation}
\psi_{vol}(J) = \frac{G_{vol}}{2}\left[3(J^{2/3}-1) -\ln J^2\right].
\end{equation}
The above volumetric constitutive assumption is one of the most common in modelling hyper-elastic material. However, as shown in \cite{vol}, this has several limitation in the regime of large deformation, which highlights the need of study more realistic form which can capture the more complex behaviour of real material. From this point of view, being able to decouple the volumetric deformation as in model B allows to investigate this aspect alone [REPHRASE].

When looking at the entropy production, Equation~(\ref{dis}) still holds simply by replacing $\LL_v$ with $\bar{\LL}_v$:
\begin{equation}
\LL_v = \frac{G^B_2}{\eta^B}\text{DEV}[\bar{\mathbb{C}}_e]\label{Lv2}
\end{equation}
 Using the same argument as in Section~(\ref{ent}), we are left with the following system of equations:
\begin{gather}
\boldsymbol{\xi} = \gamma J \,\mathbb{B}^{-1} \,\nabla_0 \,C_s,\label{sys1B}\\[2mm]
\begin{aligned}
\mu_s = p v + \mu_s^0 - \gamma J \nabla^2 C_s + kT&\left[\ln \frac{C_s v}{1+C_s v} + \frac{1}{1+C_sv}\right.\\
&\left.\ \ \ \ \ \ +\frac{\chi}{(1+C_s v)^2}-\sum_i \frac{C_i}{C_s}\right], 
\end{aligned}\\[2.5mm]
\mu_i = \mu^0_i + e\Phi z_i + kT \ln \frac{C_i}{C_s},\\
\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon J} \F^T \F\, \mathbf{H}\, \\[3mm]
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{T}= \left(\frac{\kappa}{1+C_sv_s}-p\right) \mathbb{I} + \frac{G^B_1}{1+C_sv}\text{DEV}[\bar{\B}] + \frac{G^B_2}{1+C_sv}\text{DEV}[\bar{\B}_e]\\
+ \gamma \left[\frac{1}{2} |\nabla C_s|^2\mathbb{I} - \nabla C_s \otimes \nabla C_s\right]+ \epsilon \left[\frac{1}{2} \,|\nabla \Phi|^2\mathbb{I} -\nabla \Phi \otimes \nabla \Phi\right],\label{sys2B}
\end{aligned}
\end{gather}
coupled to the governing equations:
\begin{gather}
\mathbf{j}_s = -K c_s \left(c_s\nabla \mu_s +\sum_i \frac{D_i}{D^0_i} c_i \nabla \mu_i\right),\\
\mathbf{j}_i = - \frac{D_i}{k_B T}c_i\nabla \mu_i + \frac{D_i}{D^0_i} \frac{c_i}{c_s} \mathbf{j}_s, \\
\dot{\bar{\B}}_e = \bar{\B}_e \bar{\LL}^T +\bar{\LL} \bar{\B}_e -\frac{1}{\tau_R} \bar{\B}_e \text{DEV}\left[\bar{\B}_e\right]\label{BeB}
\end{gather}

In the case of free swelling, due to the symmetry of $\F$, the tensors $\F_e$ and $\bar{F}_e$ is of the similar form, $\F_e=\lambda_e \mathbb{I}$. Consequently, based on Equation~(\ref{apBe}) in Appendix \ref{apenergy}, we have that the viscous contribution vanish so that $\B_e=\B= \lambda^2 \mathbb{I}$. Substituting this result and the boundary condition~(\ref{free1})-(\ref{free2}) into Equations (\ref{sys1})-(\ref{sys2}) and (\ref{sys3}), setting to zero all spatial derivative, we obtain:
\begin{gather}
p_A = \frac{G^A_1+G^A_2}{1+C_sv_s}(\lambda^2-1),\label{presA}\\
\Pi^{n}_A = \frac{k_BT}{v_s} \left[\ln \frac{C_s v_s}{1+C_s v_s} + \frac{1}{1+C_sv_s} +\frac{\chi}{(1+C_s v_s)^2}\right],\\
\Pi^{ion}_A = k_B T \sum_i \left(\frac{C_i}{v_sC_s}-c^0\right),\\
0 = \frac{v_s}{k_BT} (p_A+\Pi^{n}_A-\Pi^{ion}_A), \\[2mm]
0 = \pm\frac{e}{k_B T} \phi  + \ln \frac{C_\pm}{C_s v_s c_\pm^0},\qquad i=1,\ldots,N,\\[2.5mm]
Q = e\left(C_+-C_-+z_f C_{f}\right)=0.\label{electron}
\end{gather}
where $\Pi^{n}$ and $\Pi^{ion}_A$ are the osmotic pressures due to the mixing of the polymer network with the solvent and the imbalance of ions inside and outside the ECM. 
Note that at equilibrium the system reaches a balance between the mechanical pressure $p_A$ and the osmotic pressures. Moreover, the electro-neutrality condition is naturally imposed, Equation~(\ref{electron}). 
Note that Equation~(\ref{eqion}) corresponds to the well known Donnan Equilibrium \cite{DROZDOVph}. Equation~(\ref{eqF}) instead implicitly defines the concentration $C_s$ and thus the final swelling volume. As expected, the latter can be controlled by changing the concentration of ions in the bath. We also notice that, free swelling experiment, are not sufficient to differentiate the elastic properties of the two branches as the two behave equivalently.
